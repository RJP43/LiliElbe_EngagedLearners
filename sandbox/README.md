# Learner's Sandbox

This directory acts as a makers' space and is meant to always be in flux. In addition to the documents uploaded here by Learners after our first February class meeting, Learners are encouraged to upload homework and in-class exercises in order to recieve the instructor's and fellow classmates' assistance. Learners are also encouraged to share class notes and resources in this space.
