You know I love you so bad
I don't believe in love
You know I love you so bad, so bad
You know I love you so bad
Like the kid in the back of the classroom
Who can't do the math cos he can't see the blackboard, so bad
You know I love you so bad
Like the kid skipping class in the bathrooms
Sneaking cigarettes underneath the football bleachers baby, so bad
You know I love you so bad
Like the kids growing up to be criminals
Tearing pages out the back of the hymnals
Love notes baby, so bad
Still remember so bad
The nights mom got drunker than dad did
She told me, "never hang out with the bad kids"
What can you say to that?
I always knew I was bad
Always dreaming so they called me the Spaceman
You first kissed me in your parent's blue basement
I wanted you baby so bad
Sometimes we got out of hand
We bought drugs from a parking attendant
But sober nights in your car were transcendent
I loved you baby so bad
You know I loved you so bad
Somehow you got yourself accepted to college
You said there had to be a way out of all this
Garbage small town rat trap
You moved away that was that
You still send me the occasional email
I got a dumb job working in retail
I miss you baby so bad, so bad
I drew your name in the sand
I came to the beach cos we used to go here
I watched the blue wave cover it over
And do what the ocean does best
I know the past is the past
Then again, the present's nothing without it
I feel fine, don't even feel sad about it
I just love you baby so bad
So bad so bad
