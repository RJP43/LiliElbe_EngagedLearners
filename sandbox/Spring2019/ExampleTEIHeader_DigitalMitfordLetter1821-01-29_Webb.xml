               end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s
               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
               Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,

                <p>My dear Friend						
               You will be sorry to hear that I have just had a letter from <persName ref="#James_Miss">Miss James</persName> who has been hurried from <placeName ref="#Birmingham_city">Birmingham</placeName> by the illness of her sister <persName ref="#James_Emily">Emily</persName> so that we shall not have the pleasure of seeing her this winter or spring. She wrote just as she was getting into the coach &amp; promised to send me word how she found her sister in a few days. She did not herself fear that her illness <pb n="2"/> was dangerous but thought it necessary to hurry home to take care of their four pupils &amp; to relieve <persName ref="#James_Emily">Emily</persName>’s mind from such a charge. This is a great disappointment--she begs me to say every thing that is kind &amp; grateful from her to you &amp; to express how very sorry she is to miss the pleasure of waiting on you.--Tell <persName ref="#Wheeler_Kate">Kate Wheeler</persName> there is no calling such a loveable person <emph rend="underline">Miss</emph> &amp; that her prescription of the syringe &amp; soapsuds has completely relieved my deafness--she will be glad to hear this for she has the <pb n="3"/> delightful quality of being in<unclear>

The last letter could be an 'o' even though it is crossed at the top like a t.--> too long--I hope he will be better tomorrow--It is such a bad thing to see him ill. How are you all my dear Friends? Your head?  <persName ref="#Webb_Eliza">Eliza</persName>’s rheumatism &amp; the dear <persName ref="#Webb_James">Papa</persName>’s Eyes? Send me a good account of you all round.--Kindest regards to everybody.
