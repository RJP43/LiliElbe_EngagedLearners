[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
