Passage 1 (from pages 286-287)
''22nd August.
      ''I am so tired, I am constantly tired, and I am still lying in bed. Almost every day I receive flowers from Grete . . . she is happy. If I had the strength, I would write and tell her that I am progressing. She would come to me; but that I don't want. I am so lonely and so weak. But when I am most dejected, a letter [286] comes from Claude; he is waiting for me—dear, dear Claude.”
