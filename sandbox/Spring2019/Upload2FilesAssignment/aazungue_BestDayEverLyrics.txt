[SPONGEBOB]
Just six more minutes left
We've done all we could do
And whatever happens next
I'm glad I'm here with you

Mister Sun came up and he smiled at me
Said "It's gonna be the best day, just wait and see"
Volcanic doomsday caught us unaware
But we're still here and Mister Sun's up there

Could be the best day ever

[SANDY]
Best day ever

[SPONGEBOB]
It still could be the best day ever

[PATRICK & SANDY]
Best day ever

[SPONGEBOB (COMPANY)]
I'm so lucky, got nothing to do
I could spend five minutes just bein' with you
Every flower, every grain of sand
(Is reaching out) Is reaching out to shake my hand

(It's the best day ever) It's the best day ever

[ALL]
The best day ever

[SPONGEBOB (COMPANY)]
(It's the best day ever) It's the best day ever

[ALL]
The best day ever

[SPONGEBOB (COMPANY)]
These past two days
The world's been closing in on me
But when I'm feeling down
I can lose that frown
Just stick my head out the window and look around

Lava doesn't scare me, it can't disguise
This magic that's happening right before my eyes
Whatever comes (whatever comes) there's just one thing to do (thing to do, one thing to do)
Make the best day ever with all of you
Today's the best day ever with all of you now

[SQUIDWARD]
It's the best day ever

[ALL]
It's the best day ever (the best day ever)
It's the best day ever (the best day ever)

[SPONGEBOB]
It's the best day ever

[PERCH PERKINS]
Best day ever

[SPONGEBOB (COMPANY)]
(It's the best day) It's the best day ever

[PERCH PERKINS]
Best day ever

[ALL]
It's the best day
It's the best day ever
Ooh

[SPONGEBOB, spoken]
This is it, everyone

[ALL]
It's the best day ever (best day ever)
It's the best day ever (best day ever)
Five
Four
Three
Two
