<quote speaker="Lili">''I am so tired, I am constantly tired, and I am still lying in bed. Almost every day I receive flowers from Grete . . . she is happy. If I had the strength, I would write and tell her that I am progressing. She would come to me; but that I don't want. I am so lonely and so weak. But when I am most dejected, a letter [286] comes from Claude; he is waiting for me—dear, dear Claude.”</quote></letter><pb/>

<passage placement="final">With a trembling voice <persName ref="Lili">Lili Elbe</persName> read the passage:

<quote source="SickLove">'''When I myself am no longer here, I want my sad book of love to be my legacy, a testimony that I once lived. I imagine that this book will be read, read as few books are, by all who are unhappy in love, into whose hands it shall fall year after year, and I feel as if I could shake them all by the hand. And I have such an unspeakable longing; it is in fact the only longing that I have, to say farewell to all—oh, none can realize what ultimate peace this would be for me.'''</quote></passage></book>
