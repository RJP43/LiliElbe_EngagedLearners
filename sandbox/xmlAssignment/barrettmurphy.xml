<verse n="1">This time it doesn’t feel like you want it all
    + Did I do something wrong to make you go?
    + Said I would know when it's all good to fall
    + Now I just need you here to hold me close</verse>
<verse n="2">Cause I don't want another heart to fill the holes
    + That you left under my covers for me to grow cold
    + I don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
    + But the city feels so lonely when you leave</verse>
<chorus>My room, where I want you
    + Tangled in my sheets
    + In your shirt that I got you
    + Half asleep, holding onto me
    + My bed where you left me
    + Tangled up, now it's noon
    + In your shirt that you gave me
    + Half asleep, wishing I still had you</chorus>
<bridge n="1">Half asleep, wishing I still had you</bridge>
<verse n="3">This time you said you’re playing games again
    + What are we becoming of it now?
    + It's fine, I said, if you're the one in my head
    + Cause I just don't know how to put you out</verse>
<verse n="4">Cause I don't want another heart to fill the holes
    + That you left under my covers for me to grow cold
    + I don't wanna miss somebody who's not missing me
    + But the city feels so lonely when you leave</verse>
<chorus>My room, where I want you
    + Tangled in my sheets
    + In your shirt that I got you
    + Half asleep, holding onto me
    + My bed where you left me
    + Tangled up, now it's noon
    + In your shirt that you gave me
    + Half asleep, wishing I still had you</chorus>
<bridge n="2">
+ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
+ Ooh ooh ooh ooh
+ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
+ I'm half asleep, wishing I still had you</bridge>
