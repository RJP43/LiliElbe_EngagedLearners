Total: 25 mins
Prep: 15 mins
Cook: 10 mins
Yield: 4 pancakes (4 servings)

Ingredients
1 pound potatoes (about 2 medium or 3 small russets, or any variety of starchy potato)
1/2 medium onion
3/4 to 1 teaspoon salt (start with a lower amount; you can add salt at the table)
Ground pepper to taste
Ground nutmeg to taste
1 large egg
1/4 cup oil (vegetable for frying)

Steps to Make It
Peel and grate potatoes. Place the grated potatoes in a clean dishcloth or cheesecloth and squeeze as much of the liquid as you can out into a bowl. Let the liquid stand a few minutes, then carefully drain, leaving potato starch at the bottom of the bowl. Add the potatoes back to the starch.

Grate the onion over the potatoes. Add salt, pepper, nutmeg, and egg. Mix thoroughly.

Heat oil in a frying pan. You can use a nonstick pan and just a few drops of oil if you wish, but for best results, use 1/8 to 1/4 inch of oil.

Drop about 1/2 cup of potato mixture into hot oil and flatten with the back of a spoon. Fry 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.

Drain on paper towels and serve hot with applesauce and or sour cream.
