1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp nutmeg
pinch cardamon
pinch clove
2 tbsp oat flour (pureed oats)
1/2 tsp ground chia seeds (or flax)
Wet Ingredients:
2 mashed bananas
3 dates

For drizzle:
1-2 tbsp brown rice syrup
Instructions

Notes

add cacao nibs on the last 15 minutes of baking if you want to add chocolate to your granola

INGREDIENTS
1. Blend peanuts until you have 1/3 cup of ground peanuts (about 3/4 cup peanuts). Set aside.

2. Preheat oven to 300Â° F

3. Mix all of the dry ingredients. Set aside

4. Mix and stir all of the wet ingredients in a saucepan on low heat until thoroughly mixed. About 1 minute. Add the peanuts to the mixture.

5. Combine the dry and wet ingredients together

6. Spread out the granola on a cookie sheet and bake for 15 minutes.

7. Take out of oven, stir, drizzle the tbsp of brown rice syrup, and bake for another 15 minutes. Make sure you do a thin line in the drizzles since it tends to make the granola more chewy if you use too much brown rice syrup.

8. Repeat stirring, bake for another 15 minutes or until golden brown.

9. Let the granola cool before breaking it up for more chunky clusters.
