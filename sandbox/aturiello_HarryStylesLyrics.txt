[Intro]
Two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Meet me in the hallway
Meet me in the hallway
I just left your bedroom
Give me some morphine
Is there any more to do?

[Chorus]
Just let me know, I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out

[Verse 2]
I walked the streets all day
Running with the thieves
'Cause you left me in the hallway
(Give me some more)
Just take the pain away

[Chorus]
Just let me know, I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know, I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out

[Outro]
We don't talk about it
It's something we don't do
'Cause once you go without it
Nothing else will do
