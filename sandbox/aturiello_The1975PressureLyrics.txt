[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You've seen so many faces that I've never seen before
I left an un-rewarding message telling you to come on
Over dramatic, automatically assume I'll stay the same

[Chorus]
There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
"We'll bleed the same way"
(Change in pressure)
Oh my broken veins say

[Verse 2]
Well I stay tuned and listen to the news
And try to fall asleep at night
Because I'm living in a house with just three walls
So I'm always getting recognized

[Chorus]
There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
"We'll bleed the same way"
(Change in pressure)
Oh my broken veins say

[Bridge]
Change in pressure
Change in pressure
Change in pressure
Change in pressure

[Chorus]
There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
"We'll bleed the same way"
(Change in pressure)

[Outro]
Oh my broken veins say
