In the dark of the night I was tossing and turning
And the nightmare I had was as bad as can be
It scared me out of my wits!
A corpse falling to bits!
Then I opened my eyes and the nightmare was me!

I was once the most mystical man in all Russia
When the royals betrayed me they made a mistake
My curse made each of them pay
But one little girl got away
Little Anya, beware, Rasputin's awake!

In the dark of the night, evil will find her
In the dark of the night, just before dawn
Revenge will be sweet
When the curse is complete
In the dark of the night, she'll be gone!

I can feel that my powers are slowly returning
Tie my sash and a dash of cologne for that smell!
As the pieces fall into place
I'll see her crawl into place
Do svidanya, Anya, your grace, farewell!

In the dark of the night, terror will find her (terror's the least I can do!)
In the dark of the night, evil will brew
Soon she will feel
That her nightmares are real
In the dark of the night, she'll be through

In the dark of the night, evil will find her (find her)
In the dark of the night, terror comes true (doom her)
My dear, here's a sign
It's the end of the line
In the dark of the night
In the dark of the night

Come, my minions
Rise for your master
Let your evil shine
Find her now, yes
Fly ever faster
In the dark of the night
In the dark of the night
In the dark of the night
She'll be mine!
