[Verse 1]
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

[Verse 2]
Jesus Freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

[Verse 3]
Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows the tune she hums

[Bridge]
But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

[Chorus]
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

[Verse 1 coda]
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

[Bridge]
But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly slowly

[Chorus]
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
