Chorus]
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong (this one's for you, you, you)
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me (you, you, you)

[Verse 1]
You tried to keep me away from temptation
Introduced me to The Temptations
Marvin Gaye and Isley Brothers
Dancing so hard the living room shaking
Yeah we dance in the house
My mama's the man of the house
Mama you too good for them men
Even dad, you too good for him
Mama, you know you inspire me
You deserve early retirement
You text me, tell me to take my vitamins
When I got a new love you invite 'em in
When we break up, you don't like 'em then (no)
Loyal, loyal, swear you super loyal
Worth more to me than striking oil
You deserve the life I'm tryna show ya
I remember all of the sacrifices
Growing up in debt, but never hungry
Rich in everything except money
That's that faith that you can't buy
But I buy that new crib, you look right in it
I buy that new car in the color that you like it in
And play my song every single time you drive in it
That's 'cause you inspired it (yeah)

[Chorus]
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard to get me on the line
I'm busy like every other time
Since I got a house in that other town
You wonder when I'ma come around
I know you worry about me
I give you attitude like, "Don't worry 'bout it"
Don't hit ya up like I don't care about you
But I hold you down, I swear I got you
I know I got problems communicating
I probably should've went to school
And got that degree in communications
I should be with you on vacation
I should take you where you should be taken
Asia, Africa, Dubai, anything you want, I do buy
Just want you to know I do try
To take care of ya, mama
You the one, you the one, you the one
You the moon, you the stars, you the sun
I'm so happy I'm your son
I'm so happy I'm your son
You love me since day one
Since before day one
So before the day's done
I gotta, gotta let you know

[Chorus]
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

[Outro]
Look, mama, you know you inspire me
If I ever made you not feel like it, then this is my apology
So sorry, look, dear mama, you know your son shine for ya
I'm Sean for ya, my lady
Don't you ever let 'em talk to you crazy
Anything for the fam, how you raise me
I'm yo baby but you still my baby
Ayy
