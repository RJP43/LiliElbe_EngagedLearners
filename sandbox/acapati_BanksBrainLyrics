[Verse]
But it's all the same
I could have foreseen
That you would act like you are
Oh, so cool, you seem
Blending with that scene
Wearing what you think is hard

[Chorus]
I can see you struggling
Boy, don't hurt your brain
Thinking what you're gonna say
'Cause everything's a game
Always trying to calculate
Trying to look smart but not too smart
To threaten anything they say

[Verse]
But it's all the same
I could have foreseen
That you would act like you are
Oh, so cool you seem
Blending with that scene
Wearing what you think is hard

[Chorus]
I can see you struggling
Boy, don't hurt your brain
Thinking what you're gonna say
'Cause everything's a game
Always trying to calculate
Trying to look smart but not too smart
To threaten everything they say
