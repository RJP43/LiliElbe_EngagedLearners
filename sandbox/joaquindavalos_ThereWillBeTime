[Verse 1: Baaba Maal]
Heto mi halanma
Mine waddimi yiddema
Ko ane tane holimi
Holimi ko ndjidirmi o Dunne Dunne
Hum hum waddimi yidde

[Chorus: Mumford & Sons]
In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live, I only live for you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have

[Verse 2: Baaba Maal]
Humm ko ane holimi
Koliyo ngopei ndjoukirade
Hasidagal modiani
Waddimi yiddema
Waddimi yiddema
Mine waddimi yiddema
Ko ane tane rokimi
Ko nanei nanei nanei nanei nanei mi waddno
Ko jonni jonni jonni jonni jonni mi watti
Ko jonni jonni jonni jonni jonni mi watti

[Verse 3: Mumford & Sons]
So open up my eyes to a new light
I wandered 'round your darkened land all night
But I lift up my eyes to a new high
And indeed there would be time

[Chorus: Mumford & Sons]
In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It’s all that I am, it’s all that I have
In the cold light I live, I only live for you
It’s all that I am, it’s all that I have

[Chorus 2: Mumford & Sons]
And in the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?

[Bridge: Baaba Maal]
There is a time, a time to love
A time to sing, a time to shine
A time to leave, a time to stay
There is a time, a time to cry
A time to love, a time to live
There is a time, a time to sing
A time to love

[Chorus 2: Mumford & Sons]
And in the cold light, I live to love and adore you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
In the cold light, I live, I only live for you
It's all that I am, it's all that I have
Why do I keep falling?
Why do I keep falling?
