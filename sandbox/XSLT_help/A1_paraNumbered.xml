                <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
                <p part="N">To the reader unfamiliar with the unhappy byways of sexual pathology, the story
                    told in this book must seem incredibly fantastic. Incredible as it may seem, it
                    is true. Or, rather, the facts are true, though I think there is room for
                    differences of opinion about the interpretation of the facts.</p>
                <p part="N">There would seem to be no doubt about the following points. <persName key="wegenerE" instant="false" full="yes">A well-known Danish painter</persName>, whose identity is
                    shrouded in this book under the name of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas
                        Sparre</persName>, was born in the 'eighties of the last century. At about
                    the age of twenty he married, and was sufficiently normal both psychologically
                    and physically to be able to fulfil his functions as a husband. Some years later
                    a purely fortuitous happening led him to dress up as a woman, and the disguise
                    was so successful that he followed it by dressing up as a woman on several
                    occasions, on each of which those who were in the secret were surprised at his
                    apparent femininity. In fun, one of his <persName key="larsen" instant="false" full="yes">friend</persName>s dubbed him, when disguised as a woman, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>. Gradually he began to feel a change taking place in
                    himself. He began to feel that "<persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>" was a real
                    individual, who shared the same body as his male self— <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. The second personality, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, became more and more important, and <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> became convinced that he was a sort of
                    twin being, part male and part <pb style="page" n="v"/>
                    <pb n="11"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="vi"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="Introduction"/> female in the one body. He began to
                    suffer from disturbances every month in the shape of bleedings from the nose and
                    elsewhere, which he came to regard as representative of menstruation, and he
                    sought the help of many doctors, who, however, were unable to relieve him.</p>
                <p part="N">He began to study books on sexual pathology and gradually came to the conclusion
                    that although his external organs were those of a male, and quite normal (though
                    perhaps rather undeveloped), yet his body contained in it the internal sexual
                    organs of a female in addition.</p>
                <p part="N">Some of the doctors to whom he went thought him neurotic, some thought him
                    homosexual; but he himself denied the truth of both these diagnoses. One doctor
                    treated him with X-rays, and later on <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> attributed the shrunken state of the female sexual
                    organs which were found in his abdomen to the destructive effect of this X-ray
                    treatment.</p>
                <p part="N">Gradually the female personality, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, took on
                    such importance that <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> felt that,
                    unless in some way his male self could be made to give place to <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, he could not go on living. By this time he was
                    in his forties, and his failure to find any doctor who could help him to realize
                    his desire to become a woman led him to the project of suicide if nothing should
                    happen within the next year.</p>
                <p part="N">Just as things seemed at their worst he met a <persName key="warnekros" instant="false" full="yes">famous
                        German doctor from <placeName key="dresden" instant="false" full="yes">Dresden</placeName>
               </persName>,
                    who agreed that <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was probably an
                    intermediate sexual type, furnished, by some sport of nature, with both male and
                    female gonads. He explained that <pb n="12"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="Introduction"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="vii"/> there were probably rudimentary ovaries in <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' abdomen, but that these were unable to
                    develop properly because of the inhibiting influence of the testicles which
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> also possessed.</p>
                <p part="N">He proposed that <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> should go to
                        <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>, where certain investigations
                    were to be undertaken. If these investigations confirmed his suppositions he
                    promised to remove <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' male organs and
                    transplant into him ovaries from a young woman, which would, as the work of the

                  <persName key="steinach" instant="false" full="yes">Steinach</persName>

                    in <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' abdomen.</p>
                <p part="N">
               <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> went to <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>. The investigations confirmed <persName key="warnekros" instant="false" full="yes">the German doctor</persName>'s theory, and <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> embarked on a series of operations. The first one was
                    castration. His testicles were removed. A few months later he went to <placeName key="dresden" instant="false" full="yes">Dresden</placeName>, where his penis was also removed, his
                    abdomen was opened, and the presence of rudimentary ovaries was established, and
                    at the same time ovarian tissue from a healthy young woman of twenty-six was
                    transplanted into him. A little later he underwent another operation, the nature
                    of which is not explained, though it had something to do with the insertion of a
                    canula.</p>
                <p part="N">By this time he felt himself to be entirely a woman. The Danish authorities

                    female part in intercourse, and to become a mother. An operation for this

                <p style="paraText" rend="division" part="N">. . . . .</p>
                <p part="N">The case falls within the domain of sexual pathology, and comes within the
                    category of sexual intermediacy. We are accustomed to classify individuals as
                    male or female, the classification <pb n="14"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="Introduction"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="ix"/> being made at birth by inspection of the external
                    genital organs. But modern sexology has pointed out the inadequacy of this rough
                    and ready classification. It must be remembered that in the early embryo it is
                    impossible, even by the most careful examination, to determine the sex.
                    Gradually a little eminence grows up which forms the rudiments of the sexual
                    organs. At first the rudiments of the organs of both sexes develop, but later
                    only one set continues developing, while the other set remains very rudimentary.
                    If development proceeds normally, the individual differentiates sufficiently to
                    be classified for all practical purposes as a male or as a female. But even in
                    the most normal and unambiguous individual, the rudiments of the organs of the
                    other sex are present throughout life. Thus the male possesses a rudimentary
                    uterus and the female a rudimentary penis. So far, we have been speaking of the
                    primary sexual organs, or genital organs.</p>
                <p part="N">But there are a number of other, or secondary sexual characters (breasts, width
                    of pelvis, hair, etc.) which differ in the two sexes, and individuals who are
                    classified as male may have secondary sexual characters of a female type and
                    vice versa. When carefully investigated even the apparently most normal male may
                    be found to have certain physical sex characters approximating to the female
                    type, and the apparently most normal female to have sex characters approximating
                    to the male type. One is led to the conclusion that the hundred-per-cent male
                    and the hundred-per-cent female are theoretical types which do not exist in
                    reality.</p>
                <p part="N">So far we have dealt only with the physical <pb n="15"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="x"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="Introduction"/> sexual characters, but there are
                    psychological sexual characters which differ as between the sexes, too.
                    Sometimes the presence of marked physical characteristics of the opposite sex is
                    not accompanied by any noticeable psychological intermediacy, or by any change
                    in the direction of sexual desire, i.e., by any trace of homosexual feeling. In
                    other cases some degree of homosexual feeling is present and in yet other cases
                    the sexual intermediacy is marked much more psychologically than it is
                    physically. For a full discussion of this subject the reader is referred to
                        <persName key="maranonGreg" instant="false" full="yes">Professor Gregorio Marañon</persName>'s book,
                        <hi rend="italics">The Evolution of Sex and Intersexual Conditions</hi>,
                    which is available in an English translation.</p>
                <p part="N">Cases occur, though rarely, where an individual possesses the genital organs of
                    one sex, and in addition more or less complete genital organs belonging to the
                    other sex as well. Such anomalies are known as hermaphrodites, though in human
                    beings the hermaphrodism always seems to be incomplete. There is a small number
                    of curious cases of this sort recorded in sexological literature, though no
                    other case, so far as I know, has been so extreme, or so well recorded, as the
                    case of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas Sparre</persName>.</p>
                <p part="N">Thus, when I was a medical student in <placeName key="sydney" instant="false" full="yes">Sydney</placeName>,
                        <placeName key="australia" instant="false" full="yes">Australia</placeName>, about the year 1912, a man
                    was admitted to the wards of my hospital suffering from regularly recurring
                    hæmorrhages, which were thought to be due to kidney disease. Investigation
                    showed that although his external genital organs were normal, and he was married
                    and able to perform the sexual act as a male, his body contained ovaries.</p>

                <p part="N">In <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName> in 1923, I saw, at the clinic of a
                    colleague, an individual who was apparently male, but who felt himself to be a
                    female just as <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> did. This patient,
                    too, had his male organs removed at his own request, and was given injections of
                    ovarian extract. No operation was ever undertaken to determine whether ovaries
                    were present in his body or not. I saw him—or her—again in 1926, after the
                    removal of the male organs, and quite recently I received a report about the
                    case. The individual is very unhappy, and has not succeeded in becoming
                    completely a woman.</p>
                <p part="N">
               <persName key="steinach" instant="false" full="yes">Professor Steinach</persName>, of <placeName key="vienna" instant="false" full="yes">Vienna</placeName>, has for some decades been carrying on a
                    series of investigations into sexual physiology, and has had considerable
                    success in changing males into females and females into males among lower
                    animals, such as rats and guinea-pigs. He has even been successful in enabling a
                    formerly male rat to develop breast glands which function to the extent of
                    producing milk to nourish the litter of another rat; but up to the present he
                    has not succeeded in completing the transformation so that a former male could
                    become pregnant and give birth to a litter.</p>
                <p part="N">Among birds, there are a number of cases on record where hens, which have laid
                    eggs and produced many chickens, have gradually changed their plumage, begun to
                    crow, and developed into cocks, and as cocks have fertilized other hens.</p>
                <p part="N">But in human beings, although mild grades of sexual intermediacy are by no means
                    rare, cases like that of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas Sparre</persName>
                    arise but seldom; and I cannot help thinking that until we know more about
                    sexual physiology it is unwise to <pb n="17"/>

                    <pb style="page" n="xii"/> carry out, even at the patient's own request, such
                    operations as were performed in this case. It would, I think, have been better
                    to try the effect of psychological treatment. <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas
                        Sparre</persName> might either have been cured, or at least enabled to adapt
                    himself to life. By proper psychological treatment the duplication of
                    personality might have been resolved and he might have been enabled to lead a
                    reasonably happy life instead of embarking on a series of painful and dangerous
                    operations which ended only with his death.</p>

                <p n="1">The next morning <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> spoke affectionately
                    to him, pointing out lightly that he must call upon <persName key="rossiniEl" instant="false" full="yes">Elena</persName> if for no other reason than as an act of courtesy. When
                    there he could always find an excuse if he could not bring himself to visit
                        <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">her German Professor</persName>.</p>
                <p n="2">An hour later he was on his way to <placeName key="passy" instant="false" full="yes">Passy</placeName>,
                    where <persName key="rossiniEl" instant="false" full="yes">Elena</persName> lived: punctually at twelve
                    o'clock her car stopped in front of the house where <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        German doctor</persName> was staying. While <persName key="rossiniEl" instant="false" full="yes">Elena</persName> was pulling the bell, <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> whispered: "Perhaps it will turn out quite interesting
                    to see <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">your German celebrity</persName> face to face, as

                <p n="5">
               <persName key="rossiniEl" instant="false" full="yes">Elena</persName> looked very seriously at her friend,
                    who was pale with excitement. "Go on, <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>."</p>
                <p n="6">And then he blurted out: ". . . That he will not regard me merely as a sorry

                <p n="7">"No, <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, I will answer for that."</p>

                    the austere elegance of his appearance in an almost military manner. His hair,
                    which was brushed in a smooth mass across his high forehead, was dark, while his
                    small moustache, trimmed in American style, was of a light fair colour.</p>
                <p n="10">When <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> later on tried to recall these
                    features to memory his mind was a mere blank every time. From those blue,
                    deep-set eyes, which were bright and dark at the same time, radiated a strange,
                    captivating charm.</p>
                <p n="11">It was <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Werner Kreutz</persName>.</p>

                    <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> felt his heart beat faster. While
                        <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> was conducting them with a
                    somewhat ceremonious cordiality into the drawing-room, exchanging the while a
                    few words with <persName key="rossiniEl" instant="false" full="yes">Elena</persName>, it occurred to
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> for the first time in his life
                    that German was a beautiful and musical language.</p>
                <p n="13">As in a dream he listened to the conversation between the two, even when
                        <persName key="rossiniEl" instant="false" full="yes">Elena</persName> was telling <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> about him and his doleful story,
                    throwing him now and again, as if accidentally, a quick, affectionate
                    glance.</p>
                <p n="14">
                    <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> could think of nothing, and was
                    conscious of nothing but the doctor's voice. It was as if he were laid under a
                    spell, the spell of this voice. It reminded him of <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        Professor</persName>'s eyes; it, too, was light and dark at the same time.
                    Both the eyes and the voice penetrated into the innermost recesses of his
                    soul.</p>
                <p n="15">And what would this voice have to say to him? <pb n="29"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="24"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> And these eyes, what would their glance
                    announce to him?</p>
                <p n="16">A death sentence? Did he expect anything other than this? Did he expect anything
                    at all? Had he come here for any definite purpose?</p>
                <p n="17">
               <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName> stood in front of him, hardly
                    looked at him, and spoke only a few brief words to him. And <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> followed <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        professor</persName> into an anteroom, where he was told to undress. "Now I
                    feel like a sleepwalker," thought <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> in
                    a vague and remote manner. He must obey, without questioning. He wanted to say
                    something, and fumbled for German words.</p>
                <p n="18">"You need not give me any explanations, sir," <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        Professor</persName> interrupted him considerately.</p>
                <p n="19">"It hurts here, doesn't it, and there, and likewise there, doesn't it?" And his
                    hand slowly glided over <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' body. All
                    that <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> needed to do was to nod quickly
                    and shyly. An almost terrifying astonishment gripped him. How did this <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">strange man</persName> know where his pains were located?</p>
                <p n="20">And this astonishment grew into amazement when <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        Professor</persName>, to whom <persName key="rossiniEl" instant="false" full="yes">Elena</persName> had
                    handed a bundle of photographs of <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, took the
                    portraits out of the envelope and laid them on the table in the order of the
                    years marked on their backs, which <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        Professor</persName> had not observed.</p>
                <p n="21">"There we have the development clearly marked," said <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the

                    did not even nod.</p>

                <p n="23">"Ovaries!" <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> almost shrieked. "Then . .

                    excitement. Everything was going round.</p>
                <p n="24">"Extremely probable," replied <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>,
                    imperturbable and positive; yet the sound of his voice seemed slightly muffled,
                    very soft and discreet. <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was to be
                    reminded continually of this lightly veiled voice, and not merely <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. "For I think you possess both male and
                    female organs, and that neither of them has sufficient room to develop properly.
                    It is fortunate for you that you have such a pronounced feminine feeling. That's
                    why I think I shall be able to help you."</p>
                <p n="25">
               <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had to clutch at his heart. He leaned
                    over, in order not to miss a single word that fell from the lips of this amazing
                    man. He stared fixedly at him, expecting to find confirmation of his words in
                    his glance.</p>
                <p n="26">"Well, <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Professor</persName>, what am I? . . . What . . .

                <p n="27">
               <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName> rose, paced up and down the room
                    for a while as if to think the matter over, and then turned to <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> again. And once more <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> drank in his words.</p>
                <p n="28">"Come to me in <placeName key="germany" instant="false" full="yes">Germany</placeName>. I hope I shall be
                    able to give you a new life and a new youth." </p>
                <p n="29">These words were uttered with extreme simplicity.</p>
                <p n="30">
               <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> stood up and struggled for speech. </p>

                <p n="32">"Yes," answered <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Werner Kreutz</persName>. "I will operate

               <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The doctor</persName> stood apart from them thoughtfully,

                    said, glancing from one to the other.</p>
                <p n="35">"Please do," replied <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. "I have no

                <p n="36">"Well, then," began <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>, "I hear that

                <p n="37">
               <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> blushed with embarrassment.</p>
                <p n="38">"Your marriage . . . perhaps you can tell me something about it, because, as a

                <p n="39">Each of them was conscious of something fantastic at this moment, although the

                    His smile worked at this moment like a deliverance. "What is the attitude, for

                <p n="44">

                <p n="46">
               <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName> became serious again. "What you

                <p n="47">
               <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> looked down at the stranger's hand.
                    He did not know what he ought to do. He looked helplessly around the room, then

                    time, and then declared that my case was so rare that only one similar case had
                    been known up till now. He added that in the condition in which I am at present,
                    I could hardly be regarded as a living creature, because the ray treatment had
                    been a great mistake, especially as it had not been preceded by microscopical
                    examination. Now he fears that this treatment in the dark may have destroyed my
                    organs—male as well as female. Consequently, he wants me to go to <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName> as quickly as possible for the purpose of a

                    anything. I am like a wretched grub which is waiting to become a butterfly. The

                <p n="2">Out of old habit he had lit a cigarette. One after another he smoked. . . . From
                    time to time he mechanically flicked off the ashes.</p>
                <p n="3">He was a prey to that complete mental lassitude which so frequently supervenes

                <p n="4">Horrible ideas assailed him when he suddenly realized that he had now surrendered
                    himself. He fell into a fever of apprehension.</p>
                <p n="5">Suddenly he had a vision of the two beloved faces. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> . . . <persName key="rossiniEl" instant="false" full="yes">Elena</persName> . . . and
                    gradually the two faces changed into one. . . .He had only one name for them
                    both: home, and now, it occurred to him, <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>.</p>
                <p n="6">He looked out, as if he were seeking them: <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName> . . . <persName key="rossiniEl" instant="false" full="yes">Elena</persName> . . .
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p n="7">When farewells were being said he had not once leaned but of the window. . . .
                    The <placeName key="eiffel" instant="false" full="yes">Eiffel Tower</placeName> . . . the mirage in the sky

                <p n="8">For ever? Yes, for ever! And he, <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas

                <p n="9">Perhaps another being. . . . He was unable to pursue the thought to its end.

                    triad accompanied him, the fugitive. Now he heard it suddenly in the rhythm of
                    the train: fugitive . . . fugitive. . . . </p>
                <p n="10">The train raced through <placeName instant="false" full="yes">northern France</placeName>.</p>
                <p n="11">Across the landscape new townships were springing up out of the ruins. Here and
                    there were vast, strange-looking rectangles with fantastic crops. They were not
                    cornfields: they were fields of crosses, soldiers' cemeteries, plantations of
                    the dead. Cross set close to cross as far as eye could see.</p>
                <p n="12">And he thought of <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>. Why had he not
                    allowed her to accompany him? She had implored him to do so. And yet he had
                    forced her to remain behind in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName> . . .
                    and to wait. He pulled himself together, lit a cigarette, and put the thought
                    out of his mind.</p>
                <p n="13">The train reached the frontier between <placeName key="france" instant="false" full="yes">France</placeName>
                    and <placeName key="belgium" instant="false" full="yes">Belgium</placeName>. He gazed indifferently out of
                    the window. The last seat in the compartment was now occupied.</p>
                <p n="14">Through <placeName key="belgium" instant="false" full="yes">Belgium</placeName> the train crawled at a
                    snail's pace. <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> strolled up and down
                    the dining-car and mixed a cocktail. It was not yet six o'clock. The train
                    stopped at every tiny village. Passengers alighted and entered in a leisurely
                    way, as if they had endless time on their hands.</p>
                <p n="15">Then the <placeName instant="false" full="yes">German frontier</placeName> was reached, and a new engine
                    imparted new energy to the journey. Slowly the night descended, and soon the
                    train was rushing through the darkness.</p>
                <p n="16">
                    <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had lingered over his meal in the
                    dining-car and had drunk more wine than usual to deaden his feelings and lull
                    the pain caused him by the <pb n="41"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="36"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> vibration and rolling of the train. But he must
                    return to his compartment. He could scarcely keep on his feet. At length he sank
                    back in his corner again, clenched his teeth, and closed his eyes. All his
                    bridges were burned. Everything lay behind him. His whole life seemed to him to
                    be something that was past, something that was lost.</p>
                <p n="17">He resolved not to think. But his brain gave him no rest. Would it not perhaps be
                    best to abandon this fantastic experiment? For what it was proposed to do to him
                    was only an experiment after all. Would it not have been more rational to live
                    out his life to the end as it was shaped for him, to let this life ebb away from
                    him?</p>
                <p n="18">He thought of the letter which he had lately written to <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Werner Kreutz</persName>:</p>
                <p n="19">"Yours for life and death, provided <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>
                    survives."</p>
                <!--DRR 3-2-18, we added this as a letter though we need to check against the collation spreadsheet. RJP 2018-03-12,confirmed that should be just a paragraph because while reference to a quote in a letter it is not an actual letter.-->
                <p n="20">Every particle of masculine pride that dwelt in him stirred and gripped him. "I
                    must reach the goal. I must hold out." He spoke his thoughts half aloud, and
                    several fellow-travellers regarded him inquiringly.</p>
                <p n="21">He had to laugh. . . . Not in vain was he a native of <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>, where nothing is ever taken seriously.</p>
                <p n="22">"So," said <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> to himself, "let us write
                    our obituary. It's not a matter to be taken tragically."</p>
                <p n="23">And then he began rapidly to compose the sort of notice that would be published,
                    appraising him as artist.</p>
                <p n="24">"The painter <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas Sparre</persName> is dead. He died
                    in the train between <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName> and <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>. His <pb n="42"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="37"/> fellow-travellers thought he had fallen asleep in one
                    of the corner seats of his compartment. The cause of death was probably a heart
                    attack.</p>
                <p n="25">"A happy and harmonious artistic life here came to an abrupt close. He was a man
                    in the prime of life. After searching for a long time and experimenting in
                    various ways, he seemed to have found his style. His pictures, which mostly
                    originated in <placeName key="france" instant="false" full="yes">France</placeName> and <placeName key="italy" instant="false" full="yes">Italy</placeName>, were sometimes bright and bathed in colour,
                    sometimes dark and somewhat sombre, but always charged with sentiment and
                    natural feeling. Two subjects he preferred above all else: <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>, whose embankments, bridges, and towers he
                    succeeded, with no little mastery, in reproducing in their lightly veiled
                    pearl-grey atmosphere, and landscapes under lowering skies, showing in vivid
                    lights the trees and houses in the background. It was especially in pictures of
                    the latter kind, these strong, very masculinely conceived storm pictures, that
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas Sparre</persName> found an outlet for his
                    talent.</p>
                <p n="26">"We, who were acquainted with his soft, often effeminate appearance, and his
                    laughing, joyous tones in conversation, noted this with astonishment, and the
                    thought frequently struck us that whatever masculine force resided in him found
                    its outlet in these strong, somewhat wild and wilful pictures.</p>
                <p n="27">"He painted very quickly, and thus it happened that he found time to devote
                    himself to many other things beside his art. His knowledge was really
                    comprehensive. Very characteristic was an answer which we once heard from his
                    own lips, in the <placeName key="trianon" instant="false" full="yes">Trianon</placeName>, addressed by him
                    to an older <pb n="43"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="38"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> colleague. The latter had expressed his
                    annoyance at the fact that a young colleague was beginning a picture in what he
                    thought was too systematic a way. 'You must pardon me if I don't share your
                    view,' retorted <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas Sparre</persName>, 'but I do
                    believe that it is impossible to paint a leaf of a rose correctly unless one
                    knows the last thing about the influence of Assyrian bas-relief upon the
                    sculpture of the Greeks.'</p>
                <p n="28">"On another occasion he expressed himself in the following way: 'I cannot
                    understand how lightly most of my older colleagues take their art—how easily
                    satisfied they are with their performances. As for me, I calculate I should
                    require a thousand years to become a decent painter.' Thus seriously did
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas Sparre</persName> take his art, at any
                    rate.</p>
                <p n="29">"The greater portion of his life he had spent far from his Danish home—in
                        <placeName key="italy" instant="false" full="yes">Italy</placeName>, <placeName key="holland" instant="false" full="yes">Holland</placeName>, <placeName key="germany" instant="false" full="yes">Germany</placeName>, and
                        <placeName key="france" instant="false" full="yes">France</placeName>. He lived mostly in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>.</p>
                <p n="30">"The reason why he turned his back in early manhood on <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>, although his art was highly
                    appreciated there from the beginning, was because <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> and <placeName key="denmark" instant="false" full="yes">Denmark</placeName> did
                    not seem to him to be the right soil for his wife's art. In <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> he had frequently been obliged to
                    hear how much his pictures were preferred to those of his wife. And that was
                    perhaps the worst thing that could be said to him. In <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>, where the contrary was generally the case, he felt at
                    home for this very reason. He felt his wife's successes as his own successes,
                    for his dominant characteristic was chivalry towards his wife, as towards women
                    generally.</p>
                <p n="31">"For the rest, his was a complex, enigmatic <pb n="44"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="39"/> nature. Despite the inevitable influences to which
                    every artist in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName> is exposed, he remained
                    fundamentally a Northern painter, and his art, in its quintessence, had little
                    affinity with Latin, but every affinity with Teutonic influences. His personal
                    outlook was European. He maintained a constant intercourse with French
                    philosophers and writers, with Polish violinists, with Russian architects, and
                    German painters.</p>
                <p n="32">"In collaboration with a <persName key="guyot" instant="false" full="yes">French friend</persName> he wrote
                    a book about Northern sagas, which passed through many editions in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>. Of this he was not a little proud. And he
                    took pleasure in the fact that through this book he had been the means of
                    opening the eyes of the Latin reading world to the Teutonic world of ideas, an
                    undertaking which in the post-War period (the book appeared in the year 1924)
                    deserves praise as the throwing of an intellectual bridge between the Latin and
                    the Teutonic worlds.</p>
                <p n="33">"Without being himself a practised musician, he cherished a deep love of
                    music.</p>
                <p n="34">"In recent years his health had not been particularly good. He had frequently
                    complained of pains, but always in a restrained and smiling way, so that even
                    the doctors whom he was eventually obliged to consult were misled as to his real
                    condition or were unable to realize the serious state of his health.</p>
                <p n="35">"And now death has so abruptly—and to the deep sorrow of his many friends near
                    and far—terminated this versatile artistic career, which to all of us who have
                    known him must seem like an unfinished romance. . . ."</p>

                    stop." And he thought that, in much the same language as he had just been using,
                    someone else had secretly written down his career in a diary—<persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>, his faithful life's companion, as she too
                    thought that he would die suddenly. One night he had found her asleep over her

                    perfect strangers was repellent to his fastidiousness. An unconquerable aversion
                    forbade him to undress in the presence of other men. He had often been chaffed
                    on this account. Only <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> understood his

                    left the compartment. "They have sleeping-berths," thought <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> gleefully. He was left alone.</p>
                <p n="40">After a short time the train started again. <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> lit a fresh cigarette. Would the pain leave him in peace

                <p n="44">"<placeName key="hanover" instant="false" full="yes">Hanover</placeName>! . . . <placeName key="hanover" instant="false" full="yes">Hanover</placeName>!" the porters were shouting, And then again, a long way
                    off: "<placeName key="hanover" instant="false" full="yes">Hanover</placeName>!"</p>
                <p n="45">The sound of hammers was heard tapping the wheels, coming nearer and nearer.
                    Doors were flung open and slammed.</p>
                <p n="46">A shrill whistle blew and slowly the train moved off again.</p>
                <p n="47">
                    <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was half leaning, half lying on the
                    seat in a drowsy state. Suddenly he jumped to his feet. The door of his carriage
                    was flung open. The drawn curtains were pushed aside.</p>
                <p n="48">A <persName instant="false" full="yes">lady</persName>
               <!--unknown--> was standing in front of the door. Her
                    silhouette was sharply defined against the light in the corridor.</p>
                <p n="49">The darkness in his compartment seemed for a moment to intimidate her. But only
                    for a moment. Then she threw a small trunk upon the rack and sank wearily into
                    the nearest empty corner seat, next to the door leading to the corridor.</p>
                <p n="50">
                    <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> switched on the light again.</p>
                <p n="51">He suppressed his ill-humour at being thus suddenly jerked out of his solitude.
                    "The train will not stop again until it reaches <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>," he thought, "and so there is no hope of being alone
                    again." Should he move into the adjoining compartment? Perhaps it was empty. But
                    he immediately rejected the idea. He could not hurt the lady's feelings by
                    appearing discourteous.</p>
                <p n="52">He sat up straight in his seat, and observed his companion without her noticing
                    it.</p>
                <p n="53">What struck him was the expression of her eyes. She did not seem to be seeing him
                    at all; she did <pb n="49"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="42"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> not seem to be aware that she was sharing the
                    tiny compartment with a man.</p>
                <p n="54">He looked in front of him. He stared at his fingers. But his eyes were soon fixed
                    on her again, and he noted with astonishment that she was weeping.</p>
                <p n="55">The tears were starting from her eyes. She must have seen that he was looking at
                    her; but in spite of this she did not make the least attempt to hide her weeping
                    or dry her tears.</p>
                <p n="56">She was obviously quite young. Plaits of fair hair framed a smooth, narrow,
                    girlish forehead. Her eyes, dimmed with tears, were bright blue and at other
                    times could sparkle with gaiety. She had removed her gloves. He noticed a plain
                    ring on a finger of her left hand. She was a bride, then.</p>
                <p n="57">Profound sympathy stirred in him.</p>
                <p n="58">"Mademoiselle . . ." he began.</p>
                <p n="59">She did not seem to hear him. Probably he had spoken too softly, or the roar of
                    the train had drowned his words.</p>
                <p n="60">Then it occurred to him that he was now in <placeName key="germany" instant="false" full="yes">Germany</placeName>.</p>
                <p n="61">"Gnädiges Fräulein . . ." he repeated, almost embarrassed.</p>
                <p n="62">She raised her weeping eyes. "What an enchanting bride!" thought <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p n="63">"I should like so much to help you," he said. "You seem to be in great trouble. .
                    . ."</p>
                <p n="64">He could get no further. She covered her face with her hands and wept as if her
                    heart would break. Then, between her sobs, she handed him a folded newspaper,
                    which she had been hugging the whole time. Only then did <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> notice it. He <pb n="50"/>

                    <pb style="page" n="43"/> took the paper, but did not know what to do with it.
                    He rose from his seat and sat beside the weeping girl and stroked her hand. She
                    became calmer.</p>
                <p n="65">It appeared that her <persName key="pianistXX" instant="false" full="yes">husband, a well-known

                    two days before in order to give a concert in that city. This very evening he
                    had been expected to return. On the way to the station to meet him, she had
                    chanced to buy a newspaper, <hi rend="italics">the</hi> newspaper which
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was now holding in his hand, and

                <p n="66">She pointed to the place on the front page and wept again.</p>

                    to his hotel, his taxi-cab colliding with a tramcar. He is now lying in

                    serious injuries. His condition gives rise to the gravest anxiety. </p>

                    <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was shocked when he read the report.
                    He had offered his help to the unhappy <persName instant="false" full="yes">bride</persName>. Now he felt
                    like an idle chatterer.</p>
                <p n="70">And yet, little as he had ever been able to help himself, in the case of others
                    he had frequently been able to alleviate pain by means of a mystic force which
                    appeared to dwell in him. How often had not <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and <persName key="rossiniEl" instant="false" full="yes">Elena</persName> assured him
                    of this?</p>
                <p n="71">The young lady's feverish hands were now lying in his. He clasped them tightly
                    for a long time. At first she quivered like a captive bird. Then the quivering
                    grew less and less. He did not utter a word; he merely stroked very softly the
                    limp, girlish hands. She too was silent. He could hear her <pb n="51"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="44"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> gentle breathing, and then her breathing became
                    more and more regular. Her head sank on his shoulder, and she fell asleep. Now
                    her heart was beating softly against his hand, which he had been obliged to
                    place around her to afford her support.</p>
                <p n="72">And he smiled happily at the thought that something of that hidden enigmatic
                    force was still left in him to-day.</p>
                <p n="73">More than once he tried to move; but each time his companion trembled like a sick
                    child, whimpering in slumber. He therefore remained sitting in a rigid position.
                    And gradually the roar of the train rocked him lightly to sleep also.</p>
                <p n="74">It was not long before he awoke, and the thought of his position forced a smile
                    to his lips.</p>
                <p n="75">Here he was now sitting, he, <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas Sparre</persName>,
                    of <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>, whom life had drifted to
                        <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>, and who was now being driven
                    northward by a fantastic destiny, overwhelmed with his own grief and needing
                    help and assistance if ever a person did, and chance had selected just him to
                    give consolation to a perfect stranger, to help her over a dark hour of her
                    existence—<!-- RJP:2018-02-02: Note from Emily on 2016-10-26: "Check: It looks like a smudge in the scan; check original"-->perhaps
                    her darkest hour. And here was this little <persName instant="false" full="yes">German lady</persName>, the
                    wife of an <persName instant="false" full="yes">unknown man</persName>, lying in his arms. And she and he,
                    each of them, were journeying, guided by by some blind providence, towards their
                    own fates . . . somewhere in <placeName key="germany" instant="false" full="yes">Germany</placeName>.</p>
                <p n="76">These were the thoughts that kept running through his mind.</p>
                <p n="77">And then a few secret tears splashed down his cheeks, and it suddenly dawned upon
                    him why all this had so happened. This charming <persName instant="false" full="yes">creature from
                            <placeName key="hanover" instant="false" full="yes">Hanover</placeName>

                    <pb style="page" n="45"/> in his arms like a blissfully confiding child, had
                    been sent him as the last woman towards whom he could act as a protective
                    male—before parting for ever from woman, from the eternal-feminine.</p>
                <p n="78">So his thoughts assumed these vague shapes, while on the other side of the window
                    a foggy morning was dawning, and the train was rushing through the sea of houses
                    which constituted <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>.</p>
                <p n="79">He realized that he must awaken his travelling companion.</p>
                <p n="80">With a shriek of anguish she started out of her sleep, and gazed at him in utter
                    perplexity. "Oh, he can't be dead!" Her words again dissolved in tears.</p>
                <p n="81">"Child," he said, speaking in a soft and confident voice, "child, I do not know
                    your name, and you do not know mine, but please believe me when I say that I
                    know he is alive."</p>
                <p n="82">She seized both his hands and covered them with kisses.</p>
                <p n="83">"Yes, indeed," he assured her, "make your mind quite easy."</p>
                <p n="84">"Oh, I am quite at ease! How you have helped me! I shall never forget what you
                    have done."</p>
                <p n="85">A few minutes later she was lost in the crowd of people on the platform.
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> gazed after her for a long time.
                    The newspaper which she had given him during the night was the only memento
                    which he retained.</p>
                <p n="86">A few days later <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> happened to read in

                <p n="1">In the company of a porter <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> walked the
                    short distance from the station to the <placeName instant="false" full="yes">hotel</placeName>. </p>
                <p n="2">"How devilish cold it is here in <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>,
                    although it is the first of March!" he confided in a tone of surprise to the man
                    who was carrying his two trunks. "In <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName> it
                    is already spring." </p>
                <p n="3">"Yes, in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>," replied the honest fellow,
                    "in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>." And this ended the
                    conversation.</p>
                <p n="4">
                    <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> turned up his collar. His teeth were
                    really chattering. He was exhausted after passing an almost sleepless night and
                    plunging into the midst of a strange world. But the unexpected coldness of the
                    temperature kept his senses fully alert.</p>
                <p n="5">Suddenly, before he reached the neighbouring hotel, the thought struck him:
                    "These two trunks contain my very last articles of clothing, shirts, collars. .
                    . . How absurd!"</p>
                <p n="6">A feeling of defiance welled up in him, as if the <hi rend="italics">man</hi>
                    were at bay, the man within him.</p>
                <p n="7">In the <placeName instant="false" full="yes">hotel</placeName>, where the manager had been advised of his
                    arrival, he was treated with exquisite courtesy. He immediately inquired whether
                        <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Professor Kreutz</persName>, who was in the habit of
                    staying in this <placeName instant="false" full="yes">hotel</placeName> almost every week-end, had
                    perchance already arrived. He was disappointed to learn that this was not so,
                    nor had any letter been left for him with the porter.</p>

                <p n="8">A few minutes later he went to his room. He took a warm bath, and by the time he
                    had breakfasted all his troubles were forgotten.</p>

                <p n="10">"Welcome to <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>," her voice sounded over

                <p n="13">And scarcely had this visit been arranged than the telephone rang again.

                <p n="33">"Your protector." . . . These words made <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' heart beat faster, and when, shortly afterwards, he was
                    sitting in a waiting-room of the spacious <placeName key="institutePsychiatry" instant="false" full="yes">Institute for Psychiatry</placeName>, he was obliged to keep repeating
                    these two words to himself—otherwise all his courage would have oozed away. "Why
                    have I been sent here?" he wondered. "What have I to do here?" He felt intensely
                    uncomfortable. In this large room a group of abnormal persons seemed to be
                    holding a meeting—women who appeared to be dressed up as men, and men of whom
                    one could scarcely believe that they were men. The manner in which they were
                    conversing disgusted him; their movements, their voices, the way in which they
                    were attired, produced a feeling of nausea.</p>

                    questions, this man explored the patient's emotional life for hours. <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had to submit to an inquisition of the
                    most ruthless kind. The shame of shamelessness is something that actually
                    exists, he thought, during these hours, and clung to this definition, which he
                    had once found in some philosophical work, in an effort to banish the feeling he
                    had of standing there as if in the pillory. His emotional life was undergoing an
                    ordeal which resembled running the gauntlet.</p>
                <p n="35">And when this torture came at last to an end, the inquisitor

                    dismissed him with the words: "I shall expect you to-morrow morning at the same

                    thus, quite incidentally, the doctor introduced a long, fine syringe into

                <p n="2">After the three of them had finished dinner, during which husband and wife had

                <p n="8">"Well, then. I <hi rend="italics">did</hi> ponder over this last night;

                    supposing that you both have as much patience as I have, I propose relating in
                    detail how all this has happened. . . . I have made a few notes, so as not to
                    lose the thread of my story. Who knows what the morrow will bring—whether I
                    shall be still I, or whether I, obliterated to a certain extent as <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, the person who is now sitting in front of

                <p n="13">"I thought it would be something like that. And as you know me to be a
                    level-headed person, who mostly takes things as he finds them—that is, without
                    letting his feelings run away with him— incidentally I have not yet forgotten
                    the shorthand of my student days—I should like to suggest, if I am not hurting
                    your feelings, that you let me take down in shorthand the <hi rend="italics">curriculum vitae</hi> which you are about to relate. . . ." He broke into a
                    laugh in which <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> joined and then

                    settled himself in an armchair, and produced a pencil and notebook. <persName key="hvideIng" instant="false" full="yes">Inger</persName> reclined on the sofa and smoked her

From him I have my dark eyes. He was not a man of
                    bracing character, but rather effeminate, much concerned with himself and his
                    own comfort. <persName key="mother" instant="false" full="yes">Mother</persName>, on the other hand, was a
                    hale woman, with healthy nerves, a Nordic blonde type, perhaps even somewhat
                    hard in her temperament, an efficient housewife and a good mother. She died
                    before <persName key="father" instant="false" full="yes">Father</persName>, quite suddenly. <persName key="father" instant="false" full="yes">Father</persName> was inconsolable. Their marriage had survived
                    many storms. After <persName key="mother" instant="false" full="yes">Mother</persName>'s death he revered
                    her like a saint.</p>
                <p n="19">"She had four children, three sons and one daughter; I being the youngest.</p>
                <p n="20">"I was a very happy child. Everybody pampered me, even my <persName key="brotherPlur" instant="false" full="yes">brothers</persName> and <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">sister</persName>. I was a great epicure, and could eat nothing but my
                    favourite dishes. From my <persName key="father" instant="false" full="yes">father</persName> I never heard
                    a harsh word in all my life. Whenever a slap was necessary, it was administered
                    by <persName key="mother" instant="false" full="yes">Mother</persName>. For the rest, she vied with
                        <persName key="father" instant="false" full="yes">Father</persName> in spoiling me, as all youngsters
                    are doubtless spoiled. <persName key="mother" instant="false" full="yes">Mother</persName> loved to dress
                    me up. I was never clad finely enough for her. Sometimes I was not allowed to
                    romp about with my playmates on account of my 'best clothes', and this was the
                    greatest distress I had to endure. <pb n="66"/>

                    skin, and dark eyes, so that strangers often took me for a girl. In a
                    kindergarten, where, as the only boy, I played with eleven girls, I was the
                    cleverest of all the children in knitting and embroidery. As a five-year-old, at
                    the annual prize-giving of our kindergarten I received my first mark of public
                    distinction for fancy-work.</p>

                    often bantered me on account of my 'girl's voice'. I took this very much to
                    heart, and thereafter made great efforts to acquire a proper youthful bass.</p>
                <p n="22">"Looking back on things now, it seems as if my childish voice was my first
                    dissimulation.</p>
                <p n="23">"In other respects my childhood was nothing but sunshine. With my <persName key="brotherPlur" instant="false" full="yes">brothers</persName> I played with tin soldiers, with my
                        <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">sister</persName> with dolls. No one saw anything
                    strange in the fact that I was fond of pushing my <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">sister</persName>'s toy perambulator, as many brothers who have sisters do
                    this.</p>
                <p n="24">"At nine years of age I went to the same <placeName instant="false" full="yes">grammar school</placeName> as
                    my <persName key="brotherPlur" instant="false" full="yes">brothers</persName>. None of us was a model
                    pupil. My favourite subjects were French and Latin, but I was also one of the
                    most assiduous users of the school library, which gave me a high place in our
                        <persName instant="false" full="yes">headmaster</persName>'s opinion. Nevertheless, I was usually the

                    French. He spoke the language correctly, with an excellent accent. Once during

                <p n="25">"Of a different stamp was my <persName instant="false" full="yes">Latin teacher</persName>. He was a most
                    enlightened man, who not only taught us Latin grammar, but took great pains to
                    familiarize us with the intellectual atmosphere of antiquity and the art of the
                    ancients. He it was who first opened my eyes to the flawless beauty of Greek
                    sculpture. It was only a vague and remote comprehension. But I can remember as
                    if it were yesterday, when bathing with boys of my own age I would often blush
                    at seeing my own somewhat slim and delicate youthful body reflected in the water
                    beside the sturdy and not particularly well-proportioned youthful bodies of the
                    others. I was really built on much more delicate and flexible lines than were my
                    comrades. Then I would think of the youthful figures of <persName key="praxiteles" instant="false" full="yes">Praxiteles</persName>, about which the Latin master had
                    been telling us a few days before. In the art-room we had also a few plaster
                    casts.</p>
                <p n="26">"This reminds me of a little scene. At that time a number of girls were attending
                    our school. One of them attended the same classes as I. Once —during the
                    interval—she put her hat on my head for fun. 'Doesn't he look like a proper
                    girl?' she cried, and my comrades laughed with me. Suddenly our <persName instant="false" full="yes">Latin

                    girl's hat in time, and before I knew what was happening I had received a sound
                    thrashing. I was then in a perfect rage, and did not realize until many years
                    later why my old teacher had then felt it his duty to punish me. We poor humans
                    . . . what do we <pb n="68"/>

                    <pb style="page" n="61"/> know about ourselves . . . how much less about our
                    neighbours?</p>
                <p n="27">"For the rest I was an ordinary boy. I was in the thick of all fights. Just
                    because I was more delicate than my companions I deliberately displayed special
                    daring. Many bruises were the result of this ambition.</p>
                <p n="28">"Incidentally I went on long walks with my <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">sister</persName>. And when I knew that no one was likely to see me—as in
                    the wood close to the town—I pushed her doll's pram, which always accompanied
                    us.</p>
                <p n="29">"In adolescence my interest in art constantly increased. When I was seventeen I
                    began to read art periodicals and to visit art exhibitions. My <persName key="father" instant="false" full="yes">father</persName>, who, being an old merchant, thought little
                    of an artist's career for me, tried several times to divert my life into a
                    'practical direction'. Thus he apprenticed me first to a merchant and then to a
                    master painter, without achieving anything except to intensify still more my
                    desire to follow an artistic career.</p>
                <p n="30">"At the same time, like every adolescent, I had my 'flame'; indeed, to be honest,
                    I must even speak of 'flames'.</p>
                <p n="31">"When my <persName key="father" instant="false" full="yes">father</persName> at length realized that it was
                    hopeless to try to interest me in anything 'practical', I was sent at nineteen
                    years of age to an <placeName key="academyArt" instant="false" full="yes">art academy at <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>
               </placeName>. Here a number of
                    good comrades took me under their wing and took care that I very quickly lost my
                    provincial simplicity and embarrassment and that I also lost my innocence in a
                    thoroughly brutal fashion. Then I met <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>.</p>

                <p n="33">"<persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> had just come to <placeName key="academyArt" instant="false" full="yes">the art academy</placeName>. She too was from the
                    provinces. We immediately became inseparable. We attended all the evening
                    lectures together. The ordinary teaching in <placeName key="academyArt" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        academy</placeName> was at that time so arranged as to divide the sexes.</p>
                <p n="34">"A <persName instant="false" full="yes">friend</persName> had brought us together.</p>
                <p n="35">"When he learned one day that we were engaged, he became perfectly furious with
                    jealousy, not really on account of <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>,
                    but, and this I only learned many years later, on account of me. But even such a
                    symptom as this is really nothing extraordinary. How many friends have not had
                    similar experiences when a woman has come between them! A year after our first
                    meeting <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and I were married. We were
                    still very young—I barely twenty, <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> two
                    or three years younger. What did we know of life, of people? We were
                    indescribably happy in each other's society.</p>
                <p n="36">"I recollect one evening in the first years of our marriage—we were then living

                    antiquity. It ran somewhat like this: '<persName key="hermes" instant="false" full="yes">Hermes</persName>,
                    the darling of the gods, had a son, and <persName key="aphrodite" instant="false" full="yes">Aphrodite</persName>, the divine beauty, a daughter. The two children were
                    perfect models of beauty. Yet they had never seen each other before when one day
                    they confronted each other in the Wood of the Gods. The girl was immediately
                    enamoured of the boy; but the boy fled from her. However fast she ran after him,
                    he ran faster still. In despair the divine <pb n="70"/>

                    and bewailed to him her love torment. "I love him, father, but he has fled from
                    me. He will have nothing to do with me. Oh, father, grant that I become one with
                    him." And <persName key="zeus" instant="false" full="yes">Zeus</persName> heard the prayer of the divine
                    child, and he raised his arm, and the next moment the shy son of <persName key="hermes" instant="false" full="yes">Hermes</persName> stood before the Olympian, and <persName key="aphrodite" instant="false" full="yes">Aphrodite</persName>'s daughter shouted with glee, embraced

                <p n="38">"About this time <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> painted the portrait

                    who was somewhat vexed: 'Cannot <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> pose
                    as a model for the lower part of the picture? His legs and feet are as pretty as

                        Larsen</persName> was aware that once, when <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> was painting a picture of a woman, I had been obliged to
                    come to her assistance with my legs. But it had really only been a question of
                    drapery. 'You really have very pretty woman's legs,' <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> had said to me jokingly.</p>
                <p n="40">"While <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> was talking to <persName key="larsen" instant="false" full="yes">Anna Larsen</persName> on the telephone, I had been busy
                    cleaning my palette. I was smoking a cigarette and scarcely <pb n="71"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="64"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> listened when <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> informed me of <persName key="larsen" instant="false" full="yes">Anna
                        Larsen</persName>'s proposal. At first I declined rather shortly. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> chaffed me, abused me, implored me, petted
                    me, and a few minutes later I was standing in the studio in costume and
                    high-heeled shoes. We both laughed as though it were a great joke. And to make
                    the disguise complete, <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> fetched out a
                    carnival wig from the depths of a trunk, a fair, very curly wig, and drew it
                    over my head. Then she attacked me with rouge and powder, while I submitted
                    patiently to everything.</p>
                <p n="41">"When all was ready we could scarcely believe our eyes. I turned round and stared
                    at myself in a mirror again and again, trying to recognize myself. Was it really
                    possible, I asked myself, that I could be so good-looking? <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> clapped her hands delightedly. 'The most
                    perfect ladies' model,' she cried again and again. 'You look just as if you had
                    never worn anything but women's clothes in your life.'</p>
                <p n="42">"And I cannot deny, strange though it may sound, that I enjoyed myself in this
                    disguise. I liked the feel of soft women's clothing; indeed, I seemed to take
                    them as a matter of course. I felt at home in them from the first moment.
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> began to paint.</p>
                <p n="43">"Then a bell rang in the corridor, and a moment later <persName key="larsen" instant="false" full="yes">Anna

                <p n="44">"She looked at me, but did not recognize the strange lady in front of her. She
                    only recognized her own clothes. Then she uttered a cry of delight and embraced

                    peeped at me from every angle. I had to turn about and assume every possible

                <p n="50">"So <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> came into existence, and the name stuck;
                    nor was it merely a question of the name.</p>
                <p n="51">"With an extravagant joke, a genuine accident of the studio, if you like, it
                    started, and for many years we played our game with <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p n="52">"A few weeks after <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s christening an artists'
                    ball was held. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> suggested that

                    world, and she designed a pierrette's costume.</p>
                <p n="53">"It was a complete success. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was one of the
                    most popular dancers of the evening. <persName instant="false" full="yes">An officer</persName> paid her
                    special attentions. Eventually he called her out for every dance, and towards
                    midnight he became somewhat obtrusive. Then <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>
                    tried to disclose her secret. It availed her nothing—<persName instant="false" full="yes">the
                        officer</persName> simply would not believe her! When she managed to escape,
                    she fell out of the frying-pan into the fire. <persName instant="false" full="yes">A fresh
                        cavalier</persName> caught hold of her, and would not let her go. On the
                    spot he requested permission to kiss her, at least, on the neck. When at length
                    she escaped from his clutches, the pierrette costume bore some trace of the
                    struggle.</p>
                <p n="54">"Another remarkable fact came to <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s notice
                    during this ball—the attitude of the female sex towards her. Several times she
                    had regarded with a friendly smile such ladies as she found attractive. But most
                    of them had returned her confident look with an icy stare. She was perplexed,
                    and at last inquired of <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> whether she
                    had behaved herself badly, whether she looked impossible. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> said with a smile, 'Our stupid <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> is very young. She does not yet know the malice
                    and mistrust of women towards other women.'</p>
                <p n="55">"It was the first time that <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was conscious of
                    possessing a separate personality. And out of this amusing incident came
                    something like a presentiment. How often have my thoughts wandered back to that
                    far-off evening!</p>
                <p n="56">"But this evening yielded another experience, which was no less

                    asked me why I had not been present, especially as <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> had been there.</p>
                <p n="60">"I explained that I had not felt well. Anyhow, I knew that the comrades enjoyed

                <p n="67">"'You can suppose as much as you like,' broke out <persName key="hauwitz" instant="false" full="yes">Hauwitz</persName>. 'You cannot go too far in your suppositions. An unheard

                <p n="70">"This ball was followed by others, at which <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>
                    became accustomed to her rôle with growing success. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> titivated her each time, so that this strange creature who
                    had suddenly emerged in <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>
                    artistic circles began to cause a stir. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>
                    gradually became indispensable to <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>.
                    For, strange as all this may now sound, it was not <hi rend="italics">I</hi> who
                    dressed up as <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, but both for me and for

                    <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> very soon became a perfectly independent

                <p n="71">"<persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> and I became two beings. If <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was not there, we spoke of her as of a third
                    person. And when <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was there—that is, when I
                    was not there—I was spoken of between her and <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> as of a third person. And soon our most intimate <pb n="78"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="69"/> friends learned all this. But it was still a game for
                    many years.</p>
                <p n="72">"In the depths of her soul <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> is utterly
                    melancholy. And to banish such feeling she summoned her playmate <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, was, in
                    fact, carelessness and serenity personified. Gradually <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> became equally important to her mistress in the capacity of
                    a model; indeed—I can say it calmly now—<persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> has
                    been <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>'s favourite model. Whether it
                    was chance or not, <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> had more and more
                    success with pictures for which <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> posed as
                    model. And she began to see in <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> a kind of
                    mascot, a talisman that brought luck. A large number of <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>'s pictures and drawings originated at that
                    time in our first <placeName instant="false" full="yes">studio in <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>
               </placeName>, in which <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> appears as model in a hundred different poses. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>'s artistic fame spread. But nobody knew who
                    was concealed behind the model. Legends sprang up around it. Rumour also began
                    to whisper, without, however, discovering the track of the secret.</p>
                <p n="73">"<persName instant="false" full="yes">A well-known writer</persName> asserted that the model <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was no creature of flesh and blood at all, but
                    merely a female type, upon which <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>'s
                    imagination had fastened, and therefore an empty caprice.</p>
                <p n="74">"Only a few suspected the connection. But nobody knew anything definite about the
                    mystery of <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>—with the exception of <persName key="larsen" instant="false" full="yes">Anna Larsen</persName>, who, however, had been sworn to
                    silence. She kept her word.</p>
                <p n="75">"One day <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> received an invitation from

                <p n="1">"Before our removal to <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName> we had already
                    made several journeys abroad.</p>
                <p n="2">Whenever we were able to spare sufficient money
                    from the sale of our pictures—we were extremely frugal in our mode of living—we
                    had travelled South, to study, to paint, and to become acquainted with the
                    world. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> had not been with us upon any of
                    these trips. There were too many new things to see for <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and I to find any time to devote to her. But as soon as we
                    found ourselves again in <placeName instant="false" full="yes">our native
                    studio</placeName>
               <!--RJP:2018-03-19:Are we tagging this?-->, she reappeared—and
                    then we had to acknowledge every time that we had really missed her.</p>
                <p n="3">"We spent almost a whole year in <placeName key="italy" instant="false" full="yes">Italy</placeName> without
                        <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>. It was the most carefree year which I
                    ever passed with <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>. The romance of the
                    South was an indescribably splendid revelation to us two children of the
                    North.</p>
                <p n="4">"How could we find time to . . . play? <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>
                    was at that time serenity itself. In <placeName key="italy" instant="false" full="yes">Italy</placeName>'s
                    wonderland she never felt oppressed. She needed no distraction. Hence <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was not conjured up by her.</p>
                <p n="5">"And yet <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was probably more than ever closely
                    bound up with us both. Only it was no longer a pastime. About that time I began

                    my influence upon <hi rend="italics">others</hi> . . . in <placeName key="italy" instant="false" full="yes">Italy</placeName> just at that time. In <placeName key="florence" instant="false" full="yes">Florence</placeName> an unfortunate person approached me. He was a

               <!-- RJP:2018-03-19: Tagged? -->. One
                    day, after he had been dogging me for weeks, he spoke to me and suggested that I
                    should take up my quarters in his villa, where I could pursue my studies as a
                    painter to my heart's content. I declined politely, but very firmly. After that
                    I saw him frequently. I was always with a lady, either with <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> or in the company of a <persName instant="false" full="yes">strikingly

               <!-- RJP:2018-03-19: Tagged? -->. A very little
                    more and I should have been obliged to challenge this <persName instant="false" full="yes">poor

                <p n="6">"In <placeName key="rome" instant="false" full="yes">Rome</placeName> I had a similar adventure. In that

                <p n="7">"Never before had I been placed in such delicate situations. Why this happened
                    just then in <placeName key="italy" instant="false" full="yes">Italy</placeName> I only realized much
                    later. When <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Professor Kreutz</persName> recently saw in

                    tenor of the revue. He was the comic character of the evening. His mere
                    appearance on the stage unloosed a storm of merriment. He was the only real
                    artiste in this company of amateurs; that is to say, he was the only member of
                    it who was not an amateur.</p>
                <p n="56">"Earlier in the day I had already noticed this young artiste, who with his droll,

                  <placeName key="montmartre" instant="false" full="yes">Montmartre</placeName> bar</placeName>. He had completely irregular
                    features and colourless, somewhat deep-set eyes, the whole capped by a funny,
                    pointed nose. At first glance he would probably appear ugly, but if one looked
                    at him somewhat longer one would become conscious of a remarkable geniality and
                    kindliness which his whole personality radiated.</p>
                <p n="57">"If anything he had given me (<persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>) the
                    cold shoulder, but his conduct towards <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was
                    of quite another character.</p>
                <p n="58">"It went without saying that, like the rest of his colleagues from <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>, he was soon 'in the picture'. As for the
                    rest, discretion was observed.</p>
                <p n="59">"And the citizens, who had arranged a charity ball after the performance was
                    over, of which we 'Parisians' were to form the centre of attraction, saw in
                        <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, who at the desire of all the

                    had remained in her stage costume, the typical Parisienne. Wherever she showed
                    herself, she was treated with exquisite courtesy. She enjoyed herself immensely.

                    she found she could skip a dance, <persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude
                        Lejeune</persName> made his way towards her, bowed in his most amusing way,
                    then, in order to show the most serious face in the world, screwed his monocle
                    tighter into his eye, even blushed a little, and said almost solemnly:
                    'Mademoiselle, may I, as soon as you have somewhat recovered, solicit the honour
                    of being your dancing partner a number of times in succession?' <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> looked at him somewhat surprised, and then
                    nodded. And during this night they danced together many times. They were both
                    about the same height. During the dancing they scarcely spoke a word to each
                    other. They danced, completely surrendering themselves to the rhythm of the
                    dance.</p>
                <p n="60">"When the last dance was over, <persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude
                        Lejeune</persName> bowed very low before <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, blushed again, and said: 'Mademoiselle, may I hope you
                    will honour the excursion we are making to-morrow with your presence?'</p>
                <p n="61">"The other comrades also begged <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, and she
                    promised with a smile. Only the 'Parisians' took part in this excursion,
                    otherwise <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> could hardly have been present.
                    The day passed in perfect harmony, and it was arranged that everybody should

                    its splendid, as well as very weighty, equipment, the craft was extremely
                    difficult to steer. At <placeName key="beaugency" instant="false" full="yes">Balgencie</placeName> the

                    very comradely way; he gave me his hand, asked about this and that; but I could
                    always remark his disappointment. In <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the studio</placeName> he would
                    then look at my pictures, although quite cursorily; politics and similar topics
                    were touched on in conversation and even the latest Parisian scandal. But it did
                    not last long, at the most a quarter of an hour, and then <persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude</persName> would look at me somewhat uncertainly.

                    club evening usually consisted of a meal followed by a ball. One evening,
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> being tired, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> went there alone with <persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude</persName>, at his urgent request.

                    did not need any other partners. Yet, before she could decline, her friend

                    until far into the night. When at length, completely exhausted, she said

                    neither more nor less. We were as little perturbed at the obviously growing
                    distinction, of an emotional kind, which increasingly manifested itself between
                    the mystical girl and myself; nor did anyone take any serious notice of the

                    Then she nodded and said in her calm, thoughtful way: 'It is strange that you
                    have mentioned something which has been on my mind a good deal lately. In recent

                    vigorous than I am,' I said uneasily.</p>
                <p n="13">"Perhaps this conversation had the effect of plunging me into a momentary fit of
                    despondency; but in other respects my health had been excellent during all these
                    years. In spite of the fact that I had never looked very robust, although I was
                    equal to every physical exertion, I had never really been ill. Just recently I
                    had frequently felt indisposed, my chief sensation being one of utter weariness.
                    Also, I had not stood too well the very cold rainy weather which <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName> had latterly experienced year after year. I
                    would cough from late autumn until spring almost without intermission. No doubt
                    that is how I came to have gloomy thoughts. One cannot be young for ever, I
                    would reflect. And then I would think of <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>.
                    She shared her body with me. She was a woman. To remain young meant more for her
                    than for me.</p>
                <p n="14">"My outlook became more and more melancholy. By nature I had always been a gay
                    person, especially as long as I lived in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>. But all this was now over. There were days, weeks, and
                    months when I felt utterly impotent. The power to work went out of me. Everybody
                    who had known me for years knew that I had been an industrious person. I could
                    not understand myself.</p>

                    and knew many things of which the layman hardly dreams. But gradually it became

                    I am very much inclined to agree with the shopkeepers.'</p>
                <p n="77">"These and similar incidents showed me that the situation was beginning to be

                    soul took any notice of her whenever she walked abroad, apart from occasional
                    pursuers. I, on the other hand, was stared at everywhere. Although I was dressed
                    perfectly correctly as a man and took long masculine strides, people took me for
                    a girl masquerading as a man.</p>
                <p n="78">"It was not to be endured.</p>

                    noticed that I was beginning to attract attention there also, although it mostly
                    found expression in a somewhat more discreet manner. In the
                    tube<!-- RJP:2018-03-26: Part of me just wants us to have the tube grabbed, but without an ID. Answer: No, there are many "tubes" says Dr. Cuaghie, and we haven't tagged vague things like "the tram" etc. -->,
                    or in the 'bus, or in the tram, I frequently caught looks and words from people
                    who were watching me. The few remarks that I occasionally overheard were enough
                    to convince me that the opinion of the shopkeepers in <placeName key="versailles" instant="false" full="yes">Versailles</placeName> was shared by others. With my
                    thorough knowledge of the sophistication of Parisians in general it became
                    doubly clear to me that I was really on the way to becoming a sensation—and this
                    fact made me more and more nervous. My nerves, which had been weakened by the
                    sufferings of long years, simply revolted: they could no longer bear the sight
                    of me pursued everywhere by wondering and curious grimaces. This molestation by
                    my fellows utterly depressed me.</p>

                    acquainted. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> had called on him a few
                    days before and had tried to explain to him my and <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s double life—and he had promised her to take me to another

               </persName>—although, personally, he regarded the

                <p n="82">"This visit to the new <persName instant="false" full="yes">specialist in <placeName key="versailles" instant="false" full="yes">Versailles</placeName>
               </persName> was to be my last experiment, I had
                    solemnly sworn to <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and myself, before
                    we set out on the journey. On my arrival I immediately received the impression
                    that the two doctors had settled their plan of campaign in advance: they wanted
                    to try to drive out of me my hysterical crochets and whims. After an extremely
                    superficial examination I was told point blank that I was a perfectly normal man
                    without any defect whatever, and that all I had to do was to try to behave as a
                    man with energy and good humour, in order to be able to lead once more the life
                    of an ordinary man <hi rend="italics">masculini generis</hi>. During this
                    summary of their profound judgment they regarded me with scarcely veiled irony:
                    they looked upon me as an hysterical subject, plainly as a fraud, and one of
                    them, <persName instant="false" full="yes">the 'new specialist'</persName>, even hinted that I was really
                    homosexual. This suggestion almost broke down my self-control. If <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> had not saved the situation by a ringing
                    laugh, repudiating on my behalf <pb n="128"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="111"/> the supposition as utterly absurd, I should have
                    seized the fellow by the throat.</p>
                <!-- RJP:2018-03-26: Interesting short scene regarding gender/sexuality studies. -->
                <p n="83">"After this hopeless consultation, which profoundly depressed us both, my last
                    reserves of strength were exhausted. And I swore to myself that henceforth no
                    power on earth would induce me to consult new doctors. I would not run the risk
                    of being degraded again for the amusement of the medicos.</p>
                <p n="84">"I said to myself that as my case has never been known in the history of the
                    medical art, it simply did not exist, it simply could not exist. Thus my doom,
                    which was also <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s doom, was sealed. All that
                    now remained for me to do was to go on living with all the patience that I could
                    muster until the short term that I had set to my life had expired.</p>
                <p n="85">"Outwardly, nothing changed in the routine of our daily life. I was even cheerful
                    when friends or acquaintances visited us, but particularly so in my behaviour
                    towards <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>, as I was afraid that she
                    might see through me. That she was seriously perturbed I could divine from her
                    whole attitude. She kept her feelings well under control, and generally showed
                    me a smiling countenance, behind which she was able to hide her despondency. She
                    had become so restless. Frequently, when she believed that I was not observing
                    her, she would look at me furtively with an air of such strange inquiry that I
                    feared she suspected my plans.</p>
                <p n="86">"During these weeks I had only one desire: to hear music. Concerts I could no
                    longer attend, as I dared not see people. Consequently, I bought large numbers
                    of gramophone records, classical and modern music, all mixed up anyhow, and
                    during <pb n="129"/>

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> long evenings our gramophone played until far
                    into the night. I swallowed everything that was music—gay and tragic, the most
                    banal and the most solemn, the most melodious and the most discordant
                    music—provided only it were music. It was my comforter, whether it moved me to
                    tears or prompted me to join merrily in some chorus, or even invite <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> to dance with me.</p>
                <p n="87">"At that time I lived on music. If I could not sleep, I fled to music. If I was
                    unable to open my eyes in the morning, <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> would fetch the gramophone from <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the
                        studio</placeName> to my bedside. It was not that I was abnormally receptive
                    or sensitive. I was never less sensitive that at this time. I merely felt
                    utterly lost, abandoned to a fate which transcended human understanding. Music,
                    the language of the soul, liberated me. Not to have to speak myself, not to have
                    to give shape to my hopeless brooding, not to think myself nor clothe my vague
                    ideas in words, was my daily and nightly prayer.</p>
                <p n="88">"Formerly I had found distraction in reading. Now I never opened a book. What

                    able to write, because it had never occurred to any author that such a person
                    could ever have existed. How could the philosophies of the Greeks and of the
                    present time assist me, which only tell us of the thoughts of men and of the

                    interior a being which demanded its existence at the price of my existence. I
                    seemed to myself like a deceiver, like a usurper who reigned over a body which
                    had ceased to be his, like a person who owned merely the façade of his

                    It was the unblemished body of a man.</p>

                    punctually paid, one after another, his last visits to the various doctors, and

                    the child blushed a fiery red and clutched hold of her mother, who regarded him

                    enjoyment of the moment. Not to lose this precious moment was the impulse which
                    found release when he painted. He usually painted feverishly, and could scarcely
                    wait to catch the picture while it presented itself to his gaze, this gaze which
                    was purified by the winds of travel, which saw more than the vacant stare of
                    others, and which was brighter than that of others. Clairvoyant. How fond he had
                    always been of this word, and how it recurred to him at this moment!</p>
                <p n="18">He had always been one with this intangible and restless something, this play of

                    himself. My pictures are only feeble echoes . . . He had been happy and very
                    humble, like an initiate. And these hours had been the only real and genuine
                    joys of his life. These joys had belonged to him, to him alone, he could not

                    many youthful years he had deprived her of? His consciousness of guilt which so

                <p n="48">He paced up and down. Once, twice, thrice. Without knowing it he began to count
                    his steps. So the room was seven paces long and six paces wide. Then he sat on
                    the bed. He regarded the room. A room in a nursing-home like countless others.
                    Bright walls, and bed and table and cupboard and the two chairs likewise painted
                    a light colour.</p>
                <p n="49">And then he began to undress very slowly. Suddenly it occurred to him that he,

                    for the last time . . . that what was now taking place was a farewell to coat
                    and waistcoat and trousers and so on and so on. For a lifetime these coverings
                    of coat and waistcoat and trousers had enclosed him. He contemplated the
                    articles of clothing, one after another, as he took them off; he hung the coat
                    over the waistcoat, and then both upon the hanger in the cupboard, as he had
                    been accustomed to do since . . . yes, since when? He stretched the trousers in
                    the trouser-press, and looked at one article after another, and stroked each in
                    turn. "What will become of you? What will become of me? Which of us here will
                    survive the other? I—myself? I—you? . . . Coat, waistcoat, trousers, shoes,
                    underclothes, socks. . . ."</p>
                <p n="50">And he picked up his hat off the table. "You too. I had almost forgotten you. Who

                    said, and started to stroke the picture. A knock was heard and the door was

                    to his surprise, the performance of the "first operation", which involved no
                    danger whatever, as <persName key="gebhard" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> explained,
                    had to be postponed to the following morning. "'<hi rend="italics">Gravol</hi>'

                    operations of this kind are best performed on an empty stomach. In a few hours'
                    time we will give you a sleeping-draught, so that the time between now and
                    to-morrow morning will not seem too long to you. And now, courage." A

                <p n="51">"So it's always wait, wait, wait, wait," he said to himself. "However, much
                    patience must one have," he said, addressing the portrait which stood on the

                <p n="52">"<persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>." . . . More he could not say; he
                    leaned back on the white pillows, stared at the ceiling, and felt tired.</p>
                <p n="53">He had struggled to the goal. He became sensible of the bustle of the day here in

                    was at the end of his forces. And the last remnant of his masculine pride, which

                    it was almost noon. He opened his eyes with a shriek. Gradually he realized that
                    he was lying in his bed. It seemed to him as if he had been crying out for a
                    long time, as if he were resisting something. Two nurses were standing beside
                    him and speaking soothing words. When he recovered consciousness he felt the
                    pains growing more violent. With an effort he regained control of himself and
                    clenched his teeth. He would leave off screaming. And, in fact, he screamed no
                    more.</p>
                <p n="67">"Did I make much noise?" he inquired.</p>
                <p n="68">"Well, just a little," said one of the nurses with a smile, "and the strange
                    thing was that your voice had completely changed. It was a shrill woman's
                    voice."</p>
                <p n="69">Then <persName key="gebhard" instant="false" full="yes">Professor Gebhard</persName> came in and took

                    splendidly. Moreover, I must congratulate you. You have a splendid soprano
                    voice! Simply astounding."</p>
                <p n="70">Towards the evening he was awakened by a fit of coughing. It seemed as if his
                    whole body were being torn asunder. The coughing was terrible. He had tried to
                    suppress it, but without success.</p>
                <p n="71">At last the fit was over, and he lay exhausted.

                <p n="78">She whispered to him: "I suppose you are surprised at the clear voice."</p>
                <p n="79">
               <persName key="hvideNiels" instant="false" full="yes">Niels</persName> nodded. "I cannot recognize it."</p>

                    until dawn did he manage to go off into a short heavy sleep. By the time he was
                    fully awake, about noon, he felt as weak as one who had been wandering through a

                <p n="82">Only now and then the question would surge up in his mind, "Who am I? What am I?
                    What was I? What shall I become?"</p>
                <p n="83">Soon afterwards <persName key="hvideIng" instant="false" full="yes">Inger</persName> came—with flowers and a

                <p n="84">"Drench me with eau-de-Cologne, <persName key="hvideIng" instant="false" full="yes">Inger</persName>!
                    Sprinkle it all over the room!" he cried, almost beside himself with joy.</p>
                <p n="85">Then she sat on the bed next to him and began to talk in confident tones. She,
                    who had previously always addressed him as "you" now used the more intimate
                    "thou". He did not realize until many days later that during these first days
                    she never once called him by any name.</p>
                <p n="86">Each day she came to see him with flowers and comforting words. So one day, two
                    days, three days passed. <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> slept most
                    of the time. No dreams came to him in the long nights, through which he was

                <p n="108">He woke up suddenly in the middle of the night. A terrible shriek startled him.
                    At first he thought that he had himself screamed. He clenched his teeth. But the

                    he looked ill and exhausted when he sat before me in the same chair that you are
                    now occupying—he said not a word about his sufferings, declined even to hint at
                    them. Instead of this we conversed in the way usual among men here, especially
                    when one comes from abroad, that is to say, about politics, while I was tapping
                    his blood. Of course, I know very well that this cannot be done without hurting,

                    It was a fine spring day. The sky was cloudless and softly blue. The air felt

                    to show a smiling face, and whispered to herself again and again: "Nobody knows

                    pressed her hands against her heart. The tears she wept were the soft tears of

                    traversing the residential districts. They passed a block of tall buildings,
                    then suddenly the cab turned round a corner. Slender, white, gleaming birch
                    trees raised their filagree-fine branches above a garden wall, behind which
                    towered a grey, solemn, massive block of buildings, comprised of many

                    with great cordiality, and ushered them into a long hospital corridor. Twilight
                    had already set in, and through the glass panes of a large folding-door at the

                <p n="5">Near the large folding-door were a few armchairs and a small table, illuminated

                    requested them to sit down.</p>
                <p n="10">They all seated themselves about the round table. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> had relapsed into silence. White-clad nurses came and went
                    and said good day. But <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> had eyes and ears
                    for nothing.</p>
                <p n="11">Only when the door of the office opened again and the two ladies were ushered out

               <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">The Matron</persName> made a sign to them, and <persName key="hvideNiels" instant="false" full="yes">Niels</persName> took <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s hand. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> remained

               <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, who had suddenly become very calm, looked
                    about her in the room. It was a large apartment and might have been a study or
                    an operating-room. In front of the large window, which gave a view of the birch
                    trees in <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the garden</placeName>, stood a chair for patients, and in
                    front of one wall was a writing-desk, full of papers. Everything in the room was

                <p n="15">When <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> returned, he sat down

                    a question. His rather stern face broke into a smile.</p>

                <p n="19">She breathed again. She was relieved of the necessity of explanations.</p>
                <p n="20">She listened to his peculiar velvety voice. A feeling of happiness stole over
                    her. <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName> spoke so sympathetically
                    about everything that affected her that she grew courageous, and suddenly began
                    to relate her experience with <persName key="karner" instant="false" full="yes">Dr. Karner</persName> in
                        <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>. But when she looked up she gazed
                    into <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Professor Kreutz</persName>' eyes, those eyes that
                    were light and dark at the same time, and her words died on her lips. She could
                    not utter another syllable. It flashed upon her that <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had been able to talk quite freely to <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>. Why could she not do so?</p>
                <p n="21">
               <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Professor Kreutz</persName> regarded her inquiringly, and
                    waited for her to proceed with her story. When, however, she failed to do so, he
                    broke the silence.</p>
                <p n="22">"I really intended you to come into the private ward immediately, but, in a most
                    unexpected fashion, every bed is at the moment occupied. This is, perhaps, just
                    as well, as we must wait a little before the operation is performed. I am
                    looking out for a pair of particularly good glands for you."</p>
                <p n="23">At this realistic argument <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> shuddered. She
                    did not know where to turn her eyes. She was overwhelmed with shame, and utterly
                    embarrassed.</p>
                <p n="24">
               <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName> seemed hardly to notice this, for

                    in a strange hotel, appeared to her as monstrous as an undeserved punishment.
                    She wanted to beg <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> to be allowed
                    to remain there, she wanted to rebel against his decision. She looked

                        clinic</placeName>. She was almost convinced that <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Professor Kreutz</persName> found her unsympathetic and that she had a

                    disagreeable appearance, and that every normal person must be repelled by her.
                    She weeps perpetually. We have gone out on a number of occasions, but, dominated
                    by her fixed idea, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> thought she could read

                    should do some painting in the interval. That was the worst thing he could have

                <p n="33">The following day <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> wrote in her

                    preceding the physical moulding into a woman. Hitherto <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> has been like clay which others had prepared and to which
                        <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> has given form and life by a
                    transient touch. Up till now, he thought, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s
                    femininity has been only superficial, not yet completely wholly genuine. By a

                    her heart to life, to a life with all the instincts of woman. The more I ponder

                    completely wrapped up in herself. True, she still weeps softly to herself at
                    times; but those are the tears of nostalgia. She does not know herself what is
                    happening to her, and I can do nothing more than assist her with encouraging
                    words and patience."</p>
                <p n="34">The next page contained the following entry:</p>

                    think of him, and then I do not quite know what to call him. I think I must call
                    him my dead brother, and to this I must get accustomed. So much so that I cannot
                    any longer realize that he and I have dwelt in the same body and <choice>

                    am the murderer of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, and this idea
                    tortures me fearfully, as I surmise that I shall perhaps be of much less value
                    than he. He was a creative person. He was a painter, with a long record behind
                    him. And just because of this I am afraid of wanting to achieve anything. For if
                    I should really once paint and then perceive that my performance fell below his,
                    this would completely upset me, and I would commit suicide!' Suddenly she said:
                        '<persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>, I see in front of me the
                    clothes of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> which we left behind in

                    And I think of them at night. And I am afraid to go to sleep again, lest I

                <p n="35">Thus a whole week passed. A deep melancholy hung over <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, and this melancholy deepened into an icy horror when one

                <p n="1">Many times <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> tried to recall the first moments
                    she spent in <placeName key="womensClinic" instant="false" full="yes">the Women's Clinic</placeName>, and
                    every time she felt again the infinite peace which had then settled upon her
                    distracted spirit. A ray of hope, which, like a Bachian hymn, was carried by
                    angel voices to an invisible vault.</p>
                <p n="2">All anxiety and unrest fell away from her. Her own life appeared to her of
                    secondary importance, and so valueless. An obscure feeling inspired her with
                    devotion, a feeling of participating in something new and great, something that
                    transcended everything that came within the range of ordinary experience. A
                    white sick-room<!--end of line, but hyphen kept to match waiting-room, etc.-->,
                    brightened by the green reflection from the garden. A white bed. Upon a white
                    table mysterious shining instruments and forceps under a glass case. An odour of
                    ether and formalin over everything. Visits from <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        Matron</persName>, a well-preserved motherly woman in white nurse's uniform
                    with starched white cap on her silver-grey hair. Now and again, penetrating
                    through the folding-door a muffled noise, gradually dying down—the sound of
                    invalid carriages rolling past. And in the white room <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>. Now and then soft voices and footfalls. The door is
                    opened, a slender figure in a white coat enters, and remains standing in the
                    room.</p>
                <p n="3">Of this first visit of <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>

                    vision. What he said to her faded right out of her mind. But from the moment he
                    stood before her in the white sick-room, all her burdens slipped away. And her
                    whole being was flooded with assurance and joyous hope.</p>
                <p n="4">
               <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> went out under the birch trees in

               <!--key unkonwn--> and waited.
                        <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName> had told her that everything
                    would be ready for the operation within a day or two.</p>
                <p n="5">The white trees gleamed silvery upon the shining green borders. Their branches
                    stood out against the grey, quivering atmosphere as if bathed in a reddish
                    sheen. Here and there hedges and bushes with their branches still bare. Silky
                    catkins on the few willow trees, and here and there yellow buds. And many seats
                    along the paths. White-clad sisters resting after lunch greeted <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> and <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>.
                    And in the middle of <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the large garden</placeName> a bevy of young,
                    pregnant women. They were laughing joyously and happily, and in their blue
                    hospital clothes looked like big crocuses just sprung up.</p>
                <p n="6">"<persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>," said <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>, "now I understand the beautiful German word
                    'fore-spring'. Everything here is so full of expectation."</p>
                <p n="7">Then a slender man in white overalls hastened across <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the
                        park</placeName> to the septic station. An <persName instant="false" full="yes">assistant

                        "<persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName>." All eyes were riveted on
                    him, and everything seemed to stop for a moment.</p>
                <p n="8">And then the turret clock of the clinic struck. Six o'clock. It was time to
                    return to one's room. <placeName instant="false" full="yes">The park</placeName> was already dark. Arm in
                    arm <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> and <pb n="194"/>

                    <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> went slowly into the large house. The
                    lights were burning in the broad, white corridors. Young nurses in white
                    uniforms, with white, tight-fitting caps, were bringing the patients' evening
                    meal. Down below, in front of <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>'s
                    room, stood <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">the Matron</persName>. Suddenly his voice
                    sounded through the open door, and <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>
                    shuddered. In a fright she drew <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> with
                    her round the corner into the corridor whereon her room was situated.</p>
                <p n="9">"What's the matter?" asked <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p n="10">"Hurry," whispered <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, breathless, and slipped
                    into her room. An inexplicable fear had gripped her at the sound of <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>'s voice. Once again she felt like a
                    schoolgirl! The next evening, when <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was put
                    to bed, she was subjected to all the ceremonies that precede an operation. And
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> sat beside her to offer
                    encouragement. <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName> had already
                    intimated in the morning that if a <persName instant="false" full="yes">young woman</persName> who had to
                    be operated upon the following day possessed suitable ovaries, the
                    transplantation should be effected forthwith. Excited and happy she bade
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> farewell this evening. She lay
                    awake for hours and stared into the white room. The night-lamp diffused a
                    subdued light. <persName key="nurseHannah" instant="false" full="yes">Nurse Hannah</persName>, young and
                    pretty, sat beside her, conversed with her, placed a sleeping-draught on the
                    night table, and then softly disappeared.</p>
                <p n="11">
               <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> did not take the sleeping-draught. She was
                    afraid of sleeping too long. She wanted to be wide awake when next morning, her
                    great morning, came.</p>
                <p n="12">Not another sound was heard from the corridors. Everything was drowned in the
                    silence of the night. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s thoughts were
                    suffused with gentle light. <pb n="195"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="170"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> It seemed to her as if she no longer had any
                    responsibility for herself, for her fate. For <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Werner
                        Kreutz</persName> had relieved her of it all. Nor had she any longer a will
                    of her own.</p>
                <p n="13">And suddenly she thought of the past, of <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>. Yet the next moment she fled from this recollection. There
                    could be no past for her. Everything in the past belonged to a person who had
                    vanished, who was dead. How altogether different from her <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas Sparre</persName> had been! Now there was only a
                    perfectly humble woman, who was ready to obey, who was happy to submit herself
                    to the will of another.</p>
                <p n="14">The turret clock chimed again. She heard it many times that night.</p>
                <p n="15">When the first streaks of dawn came stealing through the curtains, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was already wide awake. It was six o'clock, and
                    at seven o'clock <persName key="nurseHannah" instant="false" full="yes">sister Hannah</persName> came in
                    and prepared her for the operation. Then there was a long, tedious wait, during
                    which she hardly dared to move. She strained her ears for every step in the
                    corridor, every sound that penetrated thence, and every noise; but nobody
                    stopped outside her door. Had they forgotten her?</p>
                <p n="16">At length <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">the Matron</persName> came into the room and
                    conveyed to her the doleful news that she must wait yet a few days longer, as

                    A covered gangway connected the first storey with the main department of the

                    sickly smell of ether escaped from the room and penetrated everywhere. I felt as

                    the eyes, were irregular. And yet a striking harmony characterized the whole, a

                    retain it in many hasty sketches. I knew all his attitudes, all his movements.
                    This armchair had been my daily observation-post. Opposite his office. I knew
                    precisely the time he came and the time he went. His visiting times, and his

                    nothing to do with my heart. I knew that. For I had never for a moment been in
                    love with this man. And yet how often had I cried myself to sleep, thinking of
                    him! Yesterday, in the centre of the town, among strange people, I had a vision
                    of this smile. And it flashed across me that I would gladly sacrifice my life
                    for this man.</p>
                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c13d01p09">"But why, whence came this feeling? And
                    then I told myself that I was only one of the many who believed in this man
                    through the mere force of belief, who believed in the helper in him through
                    their belief in some kind of helper. As I now sat here in the armchair in the
                    white corridor I realized that my feeling for this man was nothing less than the
                    feeling which <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> cherished for him in the
                    deepest recesses of her heart. With her it is certainly still slumbering, for
                    she is as yet merely a vague being. <hi rend="italics">Vorfrühling</hi>: early
                    spring! This word suddenly sounded like music to my ears. Would <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> really see it?</p>
                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c13d01p20">"I was still sitting with closed eyes
                    when suddenly the door of the operating theatre was flung open and <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Werner Kreutz</persName> was standing in front of me . . .
                    still in the indiarubber apron. His gait was tired. He held out both his hands
                    and gave me a broad, benevolent smile. I only heard his words: 'Everything has
                    passed off well.' I clasped both his hands. And I could only stammer: 'I thank
                    you.'</p>

                    me as I write these words. A human being who was born a man, who was my husband,
                    my friend, my comrade—has now become a woman, a complete woman. And this human
                    being was never intended to be anything but a woman. Like a sacrificial animal
                    he has been dragged along with me for years until this <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">German doctor</persName> brought him help! And to-day this human being has
                    laid here bleeding under the knife of his helper. His body was opened, and
                    disclosed a state of things which the craziest imagination would hardly have
                    considered possible. The body of this human being contained stunted and withered
                    ovaries which were not able to develop because an inscrutable Fate had also
                    given him the others, the male germ glands. This secret of existing as a double
                    being, hitherto divined by no doctor, has only been unveiled to-day, after
                        <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Werner Kreutz</persName> had guessed at its existence
                    in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>, and like a wizard deciphered

                    express my meaning. And now this poor creature, so heavily handicapped by Fate,
                    has had removed from its body what had formed such an obstacle, thus enabling it
                    now to develop as its blood had dictated for years, namely, as a woman, and it
                    has been equipped with unimpaired female germ glands from another, <persName instant="false" full="yes">a

                        <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, is still lying lulled in the mists of

                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c13d01p14">"What will life now bring her? Will the

                    instruments of this fate. I not least. For it was I who many years ago enticed
                        <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> out of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, in wanton play, as a chance masquerade! And it was I

                    earnest. But I must not think of this now; I cannot help thinking of the one
                    person who never really believed in <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>,
                    but only in <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s most intimate friend, <persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude Lejeune</persName>.

                    this day, which henceforth she called the day of her proper birth. When she
                    opened her eyes for the first time, she saw a few sunbeams stealing through a
                    rift in the drawn window-curtains. Then her eyes closed again and she slept long
                    and heavily. When she awoke again, it seemed as if <pb n="207"/>

                    bed, in front of the window, she had seen the silhouette of <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>, and beside him <persName instant="false" full="yes">the head
                        doctor</persName>. <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName> had asked
                    something. Good! "Have you a good bite?"</p>
                <p n="36">She had answered with a humble: "No, <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Professor</persName>," suppressing with difficulty a smile.</p>
                <p n="37">And then <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> had ordered: "Count.
                    Either in Danish or French, just as you like."</p>
                <p n="38">She had started counting in German: "One, two, three," when an ether mask had
                    been slipped over her face. She found it difficult to breathe. She went on
                    counting: "Four, five, six, seven." The counting became harder and slower. When
                    she came to eighteen, she felt as if she were suffocating. She heard the voice
                    of <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>: "Twenty, twenty-one,
                    twenty-two . . ."</p>
                <p n="39">His voice sounded above her like the ticking of a clock, 'which grew louder and
                    louder, until everything became one continuous buzz and she lost consciousness.
                    Was it a dream?' Or had she been stupefied? But why had they left her lying here
                    so long without operating upon her? Until she had awakened with this unpleasant
                    ether taste in her mouth? "You haven't any bite?"</p>
                <p n="40">She heard this question again. But the smile gave way to a terrible pain. With a
                    shriek she opened her eyes. <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">The Matron</persName> was

               <!--error in original, should say "her"-->, smiling to her and
                    whispering: "You've come through all right. It went off splendidly. Now
                    everything is going on well." But her eyes had already closed again, and she was
                    sleeping. When she was awakened again by pains which became more and more acute,
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> was standing <pb n="208"/>

                    <pb style="page" n="181"/> beside her with a bunch of red tulips. <persName instant="false" full="yes">A
                        nurse</persName> came in, gave her an injection, and she went off to sleep
                    again. Once <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> stood beside her,
                    held her hand, and said something that she did not understand. But she saw his
                    eyes, and with a drowsy feeling sank into oblivion again.</p>
                <p n="41">That day and the night which followed it were passed in the mists of morphia.
                    When she awoke, the pains were there, but <persName instant="false" full="yes">a sister</persName> was also
                    beside her with a morphia syringe. She was conscious of acute thirst. Moist
                    cotton-wool was laid upon the parched mouth. But the injections of morphia
                    caused even thirst to be forgotten.</p>
                <p n="42">Thus morning came. Everything had really passed off very well, and peaceful,
                    natural sleep soon enfolded her again. The following days stole by softly and
                    mistily. If she was attacked by pain, it was repelled by narcotics. If she
                    opened her eyes, she would stare in front of her as if astonished at everything
                    that had happened to her. Gradually she became accustomed even to the pain; she
                    told herself that these pains were the price to be paid for what had been
                    bestowed upon her, her own life, her woman's life. The prospect was fair and
                    hopeful. Her white room in the <placeName key="womensClinic" instant="false" full="yes">Women's
                        Clinic</placeName> seemed to her like an earthly paradise. <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName> was the guardian of her paradise.
                    Morning and evening he stopped for a few moments by her bedside. Between these
                    visits all was expectation.</p>
                <p n="43">
               <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> was always at hand during these days.
                    From the door leading to <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the garden</placeName> she painted the white
                    birch trees and the garden paths. If she saw <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the

                <p n="44">It was only of the nights that <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was afraid.
                    Then <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> was far away, and the flowers
                    which she had brought had been removed from the room. Flowers had also come from

                    And letters—these letters were the sole companions of her long, long nights. And
                    the turret clock striking the hours. And . . . the pains! They started almost
                    regularly every night. Her bed would then become a glowing oven. She would lay
                    there bathed in perspiration. <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName>
                    had ordered her to sleep; but she was to have no more morphia. Other sedatives
                    were administered to her; but they were effective only for a few hours. Then she
                    would lay awake watching for daybreak.</p>
                <p n="45">And the day became fair again, and again there was the feeling of blissful
                    expectation. She listened for every footfall—she had long since been able to
                    detect the footfall of her helper amidst all other footfalls. But he did not
                    always stop at her door. Other patients had need of him. Then she would wait
                    patiently until her turn came. Here in <placeName key="womensClinic" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        clinic</placeName> everybody was waiting for <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the

                    her share, even if it were only a tiny share. When he smiled she forgot all her
                    pain. Sometimes he was strict, and then she felt a mystical fear of him. And she
                    divined that he behaved quite differently towards her than towards <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. He never hinted at the past by so much as
                    a word. Was she only <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> for him? Sometimes she
                    felt a craving to ask him about it, but she never dared to do so.</p>
                <p n="46">And for hours she would lie there and ponder <pb n="210"/>

                    impulses by being alternately mild and stern. Had he not deliberately provoked
                    an eruption of all the primitive instincts of her womanhood? She felt the
                    transformation proceeding with every new day. It was a new life. It was a new

                    the bed, in the white sick-room. But with each new day her life became
                    healthier. The pains departed. Everything took a normal course. <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">The Professor</persName> was satisfied. She was still utterly
                    exhausted. And hence it came about that she lay as if wrapt in a coma, and she
                    spent most of the day absorbed in herself and dreaming. The world outside did
                    not trouble her. She was hardly aware of it. Newspapers and books which were
                    brought to her she left untouched. She had only one wish: that nothing should
                    ever be different, that she could always remain here, in the peace of the

                    go forth into the world outside, beyond the park wall of <placeName key="womensClinic" instant="false" full="yes">this large, quiet house</placeName>, she was assailed by
                    overwhelming fear. Thus she developed a desire to remain here as a nurse, to
                    build up her strength in order to be able to help other women once she was well.
                    Now and then she broached the matter to <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> or to <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">the Matron</persName>, or the
                    other nurses, who merely nodded. Once she asked <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> if she might not speak to <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        Professor</persName> about it. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>
                    thought she might. But immediately a <pb style="page" n="184"/>
                    <pb n="212"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="185"/> fresh fear welled up in her. "If he should say no!
                    Perhaps I shall not be strong enough. Perhaps he will tell me that he did not
                    save me for this. . . ." And <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> had no
                    answer.</p>
                <p n="2">During many long nights <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s fear of life
                    outside sought refuge in another peaceful thought. Could she not enter a
                    convent, become a nun? She fell into reveries of remote, secluded convents
                    somewhere in <placeName key="italy" instant="false" full="yes">Italy</placeName>, <placeName key="spain" instant="false" full="yes">Spain</placeName>, or <placeName key="germanySouth" instant="false" full="yes">South
                        Germany</placeName>. No one should know there whence she had come and what a
                    destiny had been hers. No one. . . . She would weep for hours for fear of the
                    life outside, of this life which seemed to her like an enemy. There her secret
                    would be rudely unveiled, and she would be regarded as a phenomenon. Her fate
                    would be the subject of vulgar gossip; she would be stared at, and she would not
                    be left in peace. And the healthier her body became, the more vivid became her
                    fear of her future among people. Yet she no longer dared to speak about it to
                    others.</p>
                <p n="3">At length the morning came when she was allowed to leave the sick-room for the
                    first time. Lying back in a bath-chair she was pushed into the warm, sunny April
                    morning, into the middle of <placeName instant="false" full="yes">a soft green
                    garden</placeName>
               <!--strange that this is indefinite. Not sure if we should tag the same way as the Clinic's garden.-->.
                    It was her first untrammelled, happy day. She was like a newborn babe. All her
                    senses were fresh and full of wonder. She saw every insect which fluttered in
                    the blue sunny air and every flapping of wings from tree to tree. The scent of
                    the little yellow pink-and-white spring flowers of the hedges and borders held a
                    new message for her. And with attentive eyes she regarded a magnolia tree
                    holding up its large, glistening buds to the sunny air. Upon a branch <pb n="213"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="186"/>

                    sweet and warm. The birds twittered.</p>
                <p n="4">To keep her eyes shut, only to listen, only to smell. More than this she could
                    not do. In this posture <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> found
                    her. "You look very happy," he said, and patted her hand.</p>
                <p n="5">"My life is your work," she reflected. "And I should so much like to thank you
                    for the first spring day of my life, because you were merciful to me. I believe
                    I am the happiest creature in the world." But all this remained unspoken; she
                    felt it only in her heart.</p>
                <p n="6">"You look happy," said <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>, and she
                    merely answered:</p>
                <p n="7">"Yes, <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Professor</persName>."</p>
                <p n="8">Many happy spring days came, and at last the day also came when she could be
                    lifted out of the invalid's chair and walk a few steps in <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the
                        garden</placeName> on <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>'s arm.
                    Everything was as before, and yet everything seemed so changed, she thought. And
                    on all the paths she saw again young, pregnant women, like blue crocuses, as she
                    thought, smiling.</p>
                <p n="9">One morning, before she had strolled out into <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the park</placeName>,
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        Matron</persName> came into her room and handed her a sealed letter, which
                    had come from <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>. She opened the letter,
                    and a profound emotion overwhelmed her. A few weeks before <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> had told her that he would assist her
                    to confront the world for what she was, a woman. He had promised her to write to
                        <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the Danish Embassy in <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>
               </placeName>
               <!--id unknown but needs to be added-->. Now
                    she took from the envelope a passport, her own passport with her <pb n="214"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="187"/> own photograph, and upon the passport was written the
                    name which she had chosen out of gratitude to the city where she had found peace
                    and life itself: <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili Elbe</persName>.</p>
                <p n="10">She sank into the chair and said very softly: "Leave me alone now for a little
                    while." <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">the Matron</persName> understood and went out. For a long time <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> remained sitting very quietly on the chair. She
                    then went softly and diffidently into <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the park</placeName>, and sat
                    on a seat which was flooded by sunshine. This little booklet, her passport, she
                    held like a valuable present in both hands. It was the last day but one of
                    April. In two days it would be the first of May. <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had kept his promise. He was dead, and she was
                        alive—<persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili Elbe</persName>.</p>
                <p n="11">So <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> found her. He sat down beside
                    her. Not a word was said. The next morning he came again, and his voice was
                    softer than usual. His rather stern face beamed with benevolence. He held her
                    hands and spoke many hopeful words to her. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>
                    knew that in a few hours he would depart, and be away for several weeks. She
                    pulled herself together and tried to thank him for all he had been to her. But
                    she could not utter a word. When he had gone she felt utterly lost. Only one
                    thing gave her consolation: that she was allowed to remain in this asylum which
                    he had given her, and that she might here await his return.</p>
                <p n="12">He was leaving for <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the South</placeName>.</p>
                <p n="13">A few days later everything had become lonely and empty. Easter was over and
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> was saying good-bye. She was
                    obliged to return to <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName> for some time. It
                    was a Monday morning. The car which was to take <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> to <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the station</placeName> stopped <pb n="215"/>

                    the world and her life had changed since that day! <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> mentioned this in every letter she wrote. They were mostly

                    letters which <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> received from <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName> brought none but joyous news and many cordial

                    that <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> wrote gay, confident words to her

                    She felt invulnerable against all adversity. She was like a piece of ground that
                    was cleared for the first time. And when of a night, at first shyly and then
                    with increasing confidence, she contemplated her body, she experienced a sweet

                    after miracle was working in her. And in these nocturnal hours, quite alone with
                    herself and her joy, she could stand in front of the mirror and gaze at the
                    picture of her young woman's body. It gleamed back at her immaculate from the
                    silvery sheen of the mirror. Yet she dared not confide in any creature upon

                    smiled. So it began. And then we started chatting. It transpired that she is
                    half a Dane, her mother coming from <placeName key="denmark" instant="false" full="yes">Denmark</placeName>. She said: 'I guessed at once that you are a Dane, from

                    laughing and relating stupidities. I had just had my breakfast. As I had a very
                    poor appetite, she ate everything up in a twinkling. Then she sat on the
                    window-seat, dangled her long, pretty legs out of the window, and smoked one
                    cigarette after another. Suddenly we heard the folding door outside being
                    opened. Like a flash she was out of the window. The next moment, <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>, accompanied by <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">Matron</persName>, entered the room.</p>

                    looked at me rather strangely. I could not, of course, utter a sound.</p>

                    scarcely outside the room before I heard a ringing laugh. Smoking in the rooms
                    is strictly forbidden. But I surmised that out of sympathy with me, <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">Matron</persName> explained to <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the

                    take my revenge. She had brought her friend, <persName instant="false" full="yes">the lady
                        doctor</persName>
               <!--key unknown-->, with her. <persName key="mrsTeddybear" instant="false" full="yes">Mrs. Teddybear</persName> then told us that she was once obliged to wait

                        Professor</persName>. 'Here one learns to wait,' she had then said to
                        <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>. 'Yes, that is the first
                    thing <hi rend="italics">I</hi> teach young ladies,' <persName instant="false" full="yes">the
                        friend</persName> answered, quick as lightning. And then they both declared
                    with one voice that it was really ludicrous to be afraid of <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>, that my respect for him was too
                    comical for words. He was the most amiable man; but a modern woman who was
                    afraid of one man was a ridiculous creature. They had scarcely finished chaffing
                    me before the door opened and <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>
                    was standing in the room. And both my modern champions of the sex withdrew
                    blushingly and almost panic-stricken. Not until long after <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName> had evacuated the field did they
                    venture to put in an appearance. <persName key="mrsTeddybear" instant="false" full="yes">Teddybearkins</persName> was then very dejected. But <persName instant="false" full="yes">the learned

                    you not remain?' I asked with curiosity. 'I could not leave my poor little
                    friend in the lurch!' For the first time I laughed heartily again. It really
                    hurt me to do so. And <persName key="mrsTeddybear" instant="false" full="yes">Teddybearkins</persName> wore
                    a very guilty expression.</p>

                    instruments. If I see instruments I have palpitations. But this time everything
                    happened so quickly that I had scarcely time to think about it. In a few minutes
                    everything was settled. I began to whimper with joy, like a foolish little girl.
                    'Does it still hurt?' asked <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the Professor</persName>.
                    'No, no—on the contrary.' Then he had to smile. 'If everything functions
                    normally, you will have an injection,' he said shortly, and departed.</p>

                    clad in their richest foliage, and when the wind rustled through them it seemed

                    in vain. The wings were not strong enough to bear it. And the parents came
                    hurrying out of the nest on to the path and hovered about their young one. Their
                    twittering sounded a note of real terror. They could not get the youngster back
                    into the nest. Then <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> stooped down, took the
                    little bird in her hand, stroked it carefully, and felt the little heart beating

                <p n="16">And only many, many months later did she realize what a harsh transition from the

                    her strolls through <placeName key="tiergarten" instant="false" full="yes">the Tiergarten</placeName>,
                    through the museums and through the noisiest and most animated streets. She
                    often wanted to be alone, thrown quite back on her own resources, in order to
                    find her feet in the whirlpool of <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>.
                    For that was it—she must find her own feet, in order to demonstrate to herself
                    that she would be able to go her own way when left to herself. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> let her have her way. She was secretly glad
                    at <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s participation in the great and little
                    things of the day, although she certainly suspected that <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was having the hardest possible struggle with herself
                    during these <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName> days.</p>
                <p n="18">So it was. There were days through which <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>
                    dragged a tortured and lacerated heart, days when she was oppressed by numerous
                    fears. It is so easy, she would then think, to bear one's anonymous fate here
                    among utter strangers; but how would everything shape as soon as this anonymity
                    ceased, as soon as she was obliged to appear in those circles whence <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> has vanished, to which <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had belonged? She thought of her family in
                        <placeName key="denmark" instant="false" full="yes">Denmark</placeName>. Supposing she never returned
                    there? Would that not be the simplest? Would it not be better for her, the new
                    creature without a past and thus without <pb n="247"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="218"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> a family, to renounce everything connected with
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>? To renounce her friends and
                    relations in <placeName key="denmark" instant="false" full="yes">Denmark</placeName>? To renounce even the
                    friends in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName>, in order to start a new
                    life right from the beginning?</p>
                <p n="19">She surrendered herself to such thoughts with fanaticism, with an obstinacy that
                    eventually suggested to her the question as to whether she ought not to part
                    from <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> for ever, secretly, slipping
                    away without a word? Or ought she to speak to <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>, to tell her in quiet, simple words that their ways must
                    now part? But hardly had she addressed this question to herself than she shrank
                    from the probe. Life and the world about her, everything would become empty and
                    cold if she should renounce everything that once surrounded <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. Would it not even be cowardice, the
                    confession of a guilty feeling, if she should break all the ties with the
                    past—with the past of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>? Would not
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> become lonely if she should part
                    from her for ever?</p>
                <p n="20">These days of futile questionings were followed by nights when <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> lay sleepless and pondered upon everything that
                    had happened to her—to <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>—to <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. And the more intimately, the more
                    longingly, the more ardently she let her thoughts wander through the corridors
                    of the past, the more terrified she became. For she perceived that her whole
                    mental life had been really obliterated from the day when she had been newly
                    created in <placeName key="dresden" instant="false" full="yes">the city by <placeName key="elbeRiver" instant="false" full="yes">the
                            Elbe</placeName>
               </placeName>.</p>
                <p n="21">A horror came upon her when she saw her questions confronting her without answer,
                    as if before a mist—a mist which became thicker and thicker <pb n="248"/>

                    <pb style="page" n="219"/> and eventually extinguished everything which had
                    formerly been. Faces which <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had known
                    faded away. A desert surrounded her, an empty waste wherein not even phantoms
                    emerged from the past.</p>
                <p n="22">During such nights she felt close to madness; she dared not confide all that she
                    went through at this time to another person, not even to <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>. Only two names grew clearer and clearer in
                    her present anguish. And to the names were attached two faces, one of which
                    belonged to <persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude</persName>, and the other to
                        <persName key="feruzziRi" instant="false" full="yes">Feruzzi</persName>, the young Italian officer,
                    who, an age ago, as she thought now, although it was really no more than a year,
                    had been with them together in <placeName key="rome" instant="false" full="yes">Rome</placeName>. <persName key="feruzziRi" instant="false" full="yes">Feruzzi</persName>, with whom <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> felt some secret tie, as if instinctively imploring the
                    protection of a man, without being conscious of it in her own mind and without
                    even mentioning his name during these latter weeks. And the more ardently
                        <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> conjured up in her heart the picture of
                    the Italian friend, the more distinctly she felt his features mingling with the
                    picture of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p n="23">All of a sudden it dawned upon her what a profound and strange secret was bound
                    up with the vow which, on a far-off evening in <placeName key="rome" instant="false" full="yes">Rome</placeName>, when <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>,
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>, and <persName key="feruzziRi" instant="false" full="yes">Feruzzi</persName> were sitting together, <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> himself had taken: that <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and <persName key="feruzziRi" instant="false" full="yes">Feruzzi</persName> should be
                    united because they belonged to each other, and that <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> should disappear.</p>
                <p n="24">One night <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> suddenly woke up, stole softly to
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>, and took her hand.</p>
                <p n="25">
               <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> was sleeping. She awoke in a fright
                    and saw <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> beside her.</p>
                <p n="26">"Have I awakened you?" asked <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>.</p>

                <p n="29">
               <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> answered: "I think we were in

                <p n="30">"And <persName key="feruzziRi" instant="false" full="yes">Feruzzi</persName> was with you, wasn't he?" asked

                <p n="31">The next morning <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> wrote a short and calm note

                <p n="32">Underneath she signed her name, "<persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>."</p>
                <p n="33">After about a week she returned to <placeName key="dresden" instant="false" full="yes">Dresden</placeName>—to <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>'s home. And again

                <!-- RJP:2018-02-03: Nightmare sequence - on train -->
                <p n="1">In the sleeping-car bound for <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>—<persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> was lying
                    in slumber most peaceful and profound—<persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>
                    suddenly awoke from a terrible nightmare. She did not know what she had dreamed,
                    but it seemed to her as if she had been on the point of suffocation. Cautiously
                    she opened the window. The ferry was in the midst of the sea. It was a grey,
                    starless August night. And as she stared out, she saw a picture in her mind's
                    eye. <placeName instant="false" full="yes">The chief railway station of <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>
               </placeName> full of people, and all crying out,
                        "<persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili Elbe</persName>!" and pointing at her. And a
                    nameless horror gripped her. She could endure the sleeping-compartment no
                    longer. She dressed, and in the semi-darkness found her fur cloak, which had
                    been given her ages ago, in the early spring, in <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>. She stole out of the car, and crept along the feebly
                    illuminated gangway, up the damp steps of the ferry, and on deck. Not a person
                    was to be seen; everybody was asleep. The only sound that could be heard was the
                    churning up of the water by the propeller. The mast lights were burning dim. The
                    funnels of the steamer were spurting black smoke. From the refreshment-rooms of
                    the ship came the reflection of electric light. A few passengers were sitting
                    there. She leaned over for fear of meeting familiar faces, of being recognized
                    by anybody here. Like one pursued <pb style="page" n="222"/>
                    <pb n="252"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="223"/> she crept out of the beam of light into a dark
                    comer.</p>
                <p n="2">She shivered. "No, no," she moaned, "I cannot go to <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>." And the vision she had seen in the sleeping-car
                    below would not leave her. Her imagination painted the picture in colours ever
                    more vivid, and eventually she kept hearing out of the rhythm of the pounding
                    ship's engines the cry: "There she is! There she is! There she is! . . ."</p>
                <p n="3">Suddenly she heard footsteps. She dared not look up. She crouched closer in her
                    corner. Like a black shadow she saw a man come striding by. His footsteps echoed
                    right across the deck, died away, and then came closer, and then quite near. The
                    man stopped just in front of her refuge, and struck a match in order to light a
                    cigarette. The flare of the match cast a lurid light over the man's face.
                    Involuntarily <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> had peered into the flame.
                    She pressed both her hands before her mouth so as not to cry out. As if in a
                    fever the thought throbbed in her: This man recognized you, and you know people.
                    She shut her eyes; she seemed to be imploring the grey heavens above: "Let me
                    die." And now it was this shriek of anguish which accompanied the rhythm of the
                    engine like a perpetual cry: "Let me die! Let me die! Let me die! . . .<!--Missing endquote in original--><choice>

            </p>
                <p n="4">When at last the man had vanished, and she was again standing quite alone at
                    daybreak under the grey sky—a metallic reflection of the rising sun percolating
                    through the dreary, leaden covering of cloud—this cry of anguish kept forming
                    itself on her lips: "Let me die!" And, tired out, she dragged herself to the
                    railing, so utterly tired that she could <pb n="253"/>

                    at the dark sea, glittering here and there, without hope, with unseeing eyes,
                    too weak to resort to flight—flight from home, from herself, from nameless
                    horror.</p>
                <p n="5">Quietly she crept back into the sleeping-car. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> was sleeping soundly and had noticed nothing. Nor would
                    she ever learn of the incident, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> vowed. She
                    undressed noiselessly, crept back into her bed, and shed helpless tears. When
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> awoke, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> had exhausted herself with crying, and her face was rigid
                    as a mask. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> had to help her dress. The
                    lights of <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> were already
                    twinkling. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> caressed her companion and
                    spoke words of consolation. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> listened mutely
                    and nodded, but could not get the nightmare picture out of her head:
                        <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the railway station</placeName> with the thousand pointing
                    fingers: "There she is! There she is!"</p>
                <p n="6">But nobody at <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the vast railway station</placeName> called out her
                    name. Nor was anybody there to meet her. With her coat-collar turned up, and a
                    thick veil round her hat, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> made her entrance
                    into <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>. Helpless as a child,
                    she clung to <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> the short distance
                    across the platform and the flight of steps leading to the waiting-room. She
                    dared not look up; she trembled violently whenever she passed a group of people,
                    like a person who had committed a crime and thought she was being followed from
                    all sides. The waiting-room had only a few occupants, and they sat down in its
                    extreme corner. <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> had directed a porter

                <p n="1">Many weeks later <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> recalled to herself her
                    first encounter with <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">

               </placeName>. She
                    began to keep a diary, in order to render an account of her activities and her
                    new beginning of life. The first shocks of her week at <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> were a thing of the past. She had
                    again found peace and even a certain gaiety. She had even had strength to read
                    through the notes which <persName key="hvideNiels" instant="false" full="yes">
                  <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' friend in <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>

                    story of his life to his friend throughout a night. <persName key="nephew" instant="false" full="yes">
                  <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">Her sister</persName>'s son</persName>, a young
                    medical student, had encouraged her to start making her own notes. "You would
                    render a service," he said, "to yourself and many other people if you would now
                    record your thoughts and feelings, just at this time when you want to prepare
                    for serious creative work." Also <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the
                    Professor</persName>, her distant helper, had advised her to try to write down a
                    record of her life and experience.</p>
                <p n="2">
               <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> was not living with her. She had taken
                    up quarters with acquaintances in the town, as nobody in <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> was supposed for the present to know

                    existence. Consequently, <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> told
                    everybody who asked after <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> that he

                        <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> have it otherwise. She hardly dared do
                    more herself than leave <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the
                    garden</placeName>

                    in the evening, heavily veiled, with her <persName key="nephew" instant="false" full="yes">nephew</persName>, to take walks in <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the
                        neighbourhood</placeName> under his protection. So far her sole occupation
                    in <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> had been to help <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> to regain her freedom. It was imperative to
                    prevent the least rumour becoming public, and to proceed with all possible
                    discretion in the effort to dissolve <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>'s marriage with <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>.
                    It was a difficult undertaking, the outcome of which was by no means certain: no
                    law as yet existed which could be invoked to meet such a fantastic case. For as
                    one of the spouses, <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, no longer
                    existed, how then could a marriage between a husband who no longer existed and
                    his wife be dissolved? And yet it was precisely to this "normal divorce law"
                    which both the lawyers instructed, and the body of judges to whom the case was
                    assigned for settlement appealed as the sole juridical criterion. This law
                    required that for the period of one year prior to divorce a separation should be
                    enforced, and after the expiration of this year a further year must elapse
                    before the marriage could be absolutely dissolved. In this way <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> would lose two further years. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> could not endure this thought. She would not have
                        <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> swindled out of two years of her
                    life. And as it seemed that the lawyers could find no other way out of the
                    difficulty, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> contemplated the drastic step
                    of liberating <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> from the burden of a
                    marriage tie with one who in the eyes of the law was a dead man by her own
                    voluntary death. Then they were assisted by a suggestion from
                        <!--we might get a key for this--><persName instant="false" full="yes">an <pb n="260"/>

                    address a petition to <persName key="king" instant="false" full="yes">the King</persName>, praying him to
                    declare invalid, by an act of grace, the marriage once contracted by <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. The petition was delivered at the end of August, and by
                    the end of September <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> were summoned to appear personally at the
                    hearing. When <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> inquired whether
                        <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> was strong enough to accompany her
                    thence, she declared, beaming with joy: "If I can give you your freedom with so
                    little sacrifice, do you believe that I would think of myself even for a
                    moment?" And this journey to <placeName instant="false" full="yes">Court</placeName> was the first common
                    excursion which <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> undertook. Two ladies appeared before the judges.
                    None but their two lawyers were present. The hearing took place in strict
                    secrecy. The whole proceedings lasted barely half an hour. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> shrank from describing them, even from recording them. Nor
                    did <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> ever refer to them. And a few
                    days later, on the 6th October, they were apprised of <persName key="king" instant="false" full="yes">the
                        King</persName>'s decree, which declared invalid the marriage concluded

                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p01">"When on the second day of my stay in
                        <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> I went out to see
                        <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">
                  <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>'
                        sister</persName>—<!--there is a double dash here, should check against HTML, but it also might be a printer error-->now
                    I know and feel that I may also call her <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">my
                        sister</persName>—I entered a room which I did not know, but in which
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had often been before. When I
                    opened the door no one was in the room, and when I took the first step I saw my
                    reflection in a mirror on the wall: a big, elegant woman with smiling eyes, with
                    rouged lips, with fresh cheeks, was staring at me. I was satisfied with my
                    reflection. I knew that I had done everything to make myself as handsome as
                    possible. In my own justification. Who could reproach me for resorting to all
                    the beautifying arts to which every woman has a claim. If I should ever paint
                    myself, I would like to retain this moment on canvas. Scarcely had I regarded my
                    own person than I saw behind me another picture, enclosed by the same mirror. A
                    large fjord landscape bathed in sunlight with luxuriant vegetation on both
                    banks. My heart stopped beating. I turned round; I stared at the landscape in
                    the heavy gilt frame on the wall. It was a picture which the young <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had painted of <placeName instant="false" full="yes">his
                        home</placeName>. I looked round the room to see if anybody was observing
                    me. I saw on all walls of the room pictures of landscapes, towns, streams. I
                    recognized them all as <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' pictures. I
                    saw all his travels before me. There was <placeName key="beaugency" instant="false" full="yes">the town in

                    many joyous summer months. And not only <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>! No, I, <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, had also
                    lived down there, like a prisoner escaped from the captivity <pb n="262"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="231"/> of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' body.
                    There was <placeName key="seineBridges" instant="false" full="yes">the bridge over the <placeName key="seine" instant="false" full="yes">Seine</placeName>
               </placeName> in <placeName key="paris" instant="false" full="yes">Paris</placeName> under the threatening sky. <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had stood on <placeName key="seineBridges" instant="false" full="yes">this
                        bridge</placeName> . . . had peered down at the river and wrestled with
                    thoughts of death. And pictures by <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName>
                    hung beside them. One of them showed me <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>,
                    enticed out of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, in woman's clothes.
                    I approached the picture and could not help stroking it, while tears ran down my
                    cheeks. And I sat down on a chair in front of the table. A big album was lying
                    there. Involuntarily I opened it and turned over the pages. I found the pictures
                    of a fair boy with large blue eyes . . . pictures of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> when he was still a child, innocently happy with
                        <persName key="brotherPlur" instant="false" full="yes">his two brothers</persName> and <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">his sister</persName>.</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p02">"Then the door opened and a lady with dark
                    hair and blue eyes and trembling arms entered the room: <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">
                  <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' sister</persName>. I rose
                    to my feet and stood in front of her. And my <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">sister</persName> had to look up to me, for I was bigger than she. Then an
                    absurd recollection flashed through me: <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> and <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">his sister</persName> had
                    been the same size. From <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">my sister</persName>'s eyes I
                    saw that she was thinking the same thing, and did not know what to make of the
                    idea. I said to her: 'Good day . . be kind to your sister <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>.'</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p03">"Perhaps I should have said something
                    altogether different. I might have said: 'Be kind to me and love me as you loved
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>.' Perhaps I might have said
                    nothing at all. Or perhaps I might have only smiled and said to her: 'Do not be
                    surprised because I am bigger than our dead brother <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, for I wear ever so high heels. And don't take this
                    amiss, because <pb n="263"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="232"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> I want to be as pretty and ladylike as all
                    other well-groomed women.'</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p04">"Then we sat together on the sofa and in
                    front of us lying on the table was the album with the portraits of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> as a child. For a long time we held hands.
                    And my <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">sister</persName> was kind; she sought for words.
                    Her eyes looked at me, her lips said something. And I did not know whether it
                    was her lips or her eyes which spoke to me: 'Don't be angry with me if I cannot
                    yet properly call you by your name of <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> . . .
                    if I cannot yet arrange my ideas about you . . . if I only seek for <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> when I look at you, in your eyes, at your
                    mouth, at your hands, and at your forehead. For I loved <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' eyes and his forehead so much. I kissed his forehead so
                    often. You know that, or don't you know it? But <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> knew it. For I am only a year older than <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. And when <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> and I were quite small, he five and I six years old, I
                    was his little mother. There was never a prettier, sweeter brother than he. He
                    played with my dolls, he pushed my doll's pram. And I called him <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">"Lilleman"</persName>
               <!--we aren't sure we will keep this, since it's a nickname-->—little
                    man. Once when I wrote down the name for <persName key="mother" instant="false" full="yes">Mother</persName> and <persName key="mother" instant="false" full="yes">Mother</persName> told me that
                    I had spelt "Lilleman" with only one "n" instead of two, I said that my
                    brudderkins <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was only a "Lilleman"
                    with one "n", for he was not a proper man at all. <persName key="mother" instant="false" full="yes">Mother</persName> smiled, and you too smiled when you heard it—no . . . not
                    you . . . <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> smiled. He did not know,
                    perhaps, why he laughed. And I did not know why I had said that my <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was not a proper man at all. And do you
                    still <pb n="64"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="233"/> remember how we used to push our doll's pram in the
                    woods? <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was so fond of pushing the
                    little pram. But he was afraid that others would see him and chaff him about it.
                    And do you remember how I would then place my hands over <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' little white hands? And do you know why I
                    did that? <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> never knew why, but I can
                    tell you now. I did it only in order that if we were surprised by anybody, I
                    alone could continue pushing the pram, while <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> could quickly remove his hands from the handle, as if
                    nothing had happened.' And if <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">my sister</persName> did
                    not say this with her lips, she said it with her eyes. But it was no doubt her
                    lips. I only nodded, and kept nodding. I did not weep. I took it quite calmly
                    that for many, many days long she was seeking in me with her large, troubled,
                    woman's eyes only the picture of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>,
                    her little brother, and, as I now believe, found it. Sometimes, in the first
                    days, when we conversed with each other frequently with very painful feelings
                    for many hours, she addressed me as <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>.
                    I felt then as if I ought to die. Nor could I conceal this from her. And then I
                    would implore her to believe me that I was not <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' murderer, that if <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> had not died, I should have had to go under with him,
                    and that if I was living now, I owed him every day of my life. Once I said that
                    I really had neither parents nor brothers and sisters, as I was born not up here
                    in <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the North</placeName>, but down in <placeName key="germany" instant="false" full="yes">Germany</placeName>. And perhaps if <persName key="mother" instant="false" full="yes">mother</persName> had bore me as a girl, she would not have loved me so
                    much as she loved <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. It was probably
                    on this <pb n="265"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="234"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> day that my <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">sister</persName> said to me that everything that had happened in
                        <placeName key="dresden" instant="false" full="yes">Dresden</placeName> was an outrage against Nature;
                    had been a gamble with Fate; questioning whether <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> could not really have survived; or whether it would not
                    have been far better for <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> to have
                    borne his heavy fate and his tortured body to the bitter end. Then she showed me
                    all the works which she had collected of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, and I perceived that her whole home was really a museum
                    for <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, for all the walls of her room
                    were crowded with <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' pictures. 'Don't
                    you see,' said <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">my sister</persName>, 'what an artist we
                    have lost in him—how different he was from you?' 'Yes,' I said; 'that only goes
                    to prove how right <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was to release
                    me, for we were two beings, <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> and I. I
                    know that as a person I am far inferior to him, that I shall never be able to
                    achieve what he achieved, that I shall never be able to paint . . . that I don't
                    even want to paint. For if I did so I could never approach his standard. But
                    just because of this you can see that the beings who inhabited the body which
                        <persName key="mother" instant="false" full="yes">Mother</persName> bore were really two beings. I have
                    exchanged so much for this life which I must now live alone, as you yourself say
                    that <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was so much stronger and more
                    capable than I. He lived and worked during a long life, and I dare hardly show
                    myself. And if I show myself, you all call me a joke, a deception, a masquerade.
                    Let us, I beg you, be friends and good sisters for the sake of our dead brother
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>.' </p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p05">"Then there was the day on which she said:
                        '<persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, perhaps no wrong has been done. It
                    was <pb n="266"/>

                    was always chivalrous. And hence he released you, and withdrew his life for
                    yours.'</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p06">"It was a terribly hard contest between
                        <persName key="sister" instant="false" full="yes">my sister</persName> and me for my recognition as a
                    person, as a sister. And I know how unspeakably hard she found it to believe in
                    me as her sister <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> and to receive me, though
                    it were only out of compassion. I did not make it easy for her, for whenever I
                    showed myself, by my character and by the way in which I spoke, in which I
                    moved, in which I thought, I veiled completely the character of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. He was ingenious, sagacious, and
                    interested in everything—a reflective and thoughtful man. And I was quite
                    superficial. Deliberately so. For I had to demonstrate every day that I was a
                    different creature from him, that I was a woman. A thoughtless, flighty, very
                    superficially minded woman, fond of dress and fond of enjoyment, yes, I believe
                    even childish. And I can say it calmly now: all this was certainly not merely
                    farcical acting. It was really my character, untroubled, carefree, illogical,
                    capricious.</p>

                    was, as a woman, into cafés and restaurants. She went alone into shops to make
                    purchases, and eventually visited a hairdresser's.

                    For many days she would not stir out of her attic. She paid no heed to anything,
                    and could not understand why none of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' friends found their way to her. A little entry in her diary
                    tells of this:</p>

                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> was always ready to help them.
                    He was always a reliable friend. And now one of them says that just because he

                    recognize <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>. <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> would always stand between him and <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. He would shudder at offering her his hand. This
                    sentiment is nothing but an eruption of overweening masculinity. And another
                    excuses himself with other subterfuges. One could not be seen walking with

                    himself. <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> was too small to

                    it is unjust for me to retain his age and birthday, for my biological age is
                    quite different from his. And it is also painful for me that his name instead of

                    that one feels young and gives a youthful impression. I, on the other hand,
                    believe just the contrary—that one is, in fact, actually as old as the official

                    fantastic story to the best of my ability, in order to claim whatever rights

The achievement of <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the German surgeon</persName> must be broadcasted to the world. It must not
                    be allowed to remain a secret. It must be divulged one day, and now was the

                <p n="14">With a heavy heart, persuaded by <persName key="sparreGre" instant="false" full="yes">Grete</persName> and

                    had now become a world celebrity, and the newspapers in all languages
                    broadcasted her portrait everywhere, she went about <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> more peaceably than ever. Her constant fear, that
                    people would shout her name after her in the street, did not materialize.</p>
                <p n="16">With the exception of the few who knew her, no one imagined for an instant that

                    illustrated article about her had just appeared in a weekly magazine, in order
                    to buy a copy of this periodical. Then she sat down in a tram and read her own
                    story just like many of the others who were sitting in the car. Nobody took any
                    notice of her, although she was wearing the same coat and the same hat as in the
                    photographs which illustrated the article.</p>
                <p n="17">After this "success" she was quite reassured and henceforth had various amusing
                    experiences.</p>
                <p n="18">She went daily to <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' exhibition, which

                    did not know in the least sent her letters full of comprehension and enthusiasm.
                    Flowers were sent her by unknown admirers. Various doctors offered to attend her

                    than she.</p>
                <p n="3">At length it dawned upon her that what was affecting her so painfully was a void
                    in her life, something unfulfilled that in all probability never could be
                    fulfilled.</p>
                <p n="4">All this she felt vaguely, and yet she feared to give a name to this new thing

                    But she also felt how this mysterious craving within her for something to which
                    she could give no name became ever more clamant and insistent.</p>
                <p n="6">She began to work more and more strenuously, as if she had no time to lose. All

                    notice at the time when, if I may so express it, you were not yet born. Now you
                    are a healthy creature, but so defenceless. You are an adult woman, but you
                    often seem to me like a child. You ought to have somebody who would be both a
                    mother and a husband. In a few days I must be off again, and I find it very
                    painful to leave you here alone, exposed to all dangers, as people in <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>, where everybody knew <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, regard you, whether you admit it or not,

                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p11">"'You must go away from here.'</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p12">"I nodded.</p>

                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p14">"<persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude</persName> shook his head.</p>

                    don't forget they are a newly married pair. Have happy people, who have

                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p20">"The question came so suddenly that I
                    looked at him incredulously. 'Do you really want me with you?'</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p21">"<persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude</persName> said seriously: 'My little <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName>, can <pb n="298"/>

                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p22">"Quite involuntarily, as if I had not
                    spoken myself, I said: 'Yes, oh, yes, <persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude</persName>.' And I still heard my words ringing in my ear. They were
                    uttered without agitation, as softly as a schoolgirl speaks.</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p23">"And consequently I did not even remark
                        <persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude</persName>'s agitation when he suddenly
                    took both my hands and kissed them. Only when <persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude</persName> pressed me to him and kissed me on the mouth did I
                    realize what he and I had said, and an unaccountable feeling flooded me,
                    something which I had never perceived before, something blissful, yet
                    frightening.</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p24">"And suddenly I heard, as if coming from
                    afar, the words which <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Werner Kreutz</persName> had spoken
                    to me the last time I had seen him: 'Go out and flutter your wings and glide

                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p25">"I tore myself from <persName key="lejeuneClaude" instant="false" full="yes">Claude</persName> in terror. He regarded me with
                    startled eyes and asked me: 'What's the matter? Don't you like me any more,

                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p26">"I answered: 'You know quite well what I

                    painting her first picture, a portrait of herself. I was standing behind her,
                    but it was hardly necessary for me to tell her how to paint. I told her about
                    myself and the <placeName key="womensClinic" instant="false" full="yes">Women's Clinic</placeName> and many
                    other things which moved me and which my little pupil perhaps did not really
                    understand. We are very happy together. I saw that I could give her a good deal
                    of useful advice. After she had gone, leaving the picture she had begun standing
                    on the easel which I had inherited from—<persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, I searched among the many pictures which were still

                    picture of my little pupil off the easel, and placed the empty canvas on it. And
                    suddenly I took a brush myself and began to paint. What I wanted to paint I did
                    not know. And I painted and painted.</p>

                <p n="12">Then she sank back into a semi-conscious state of dreaming, in which she had lain

                    the edge of a precipice and yet always accompanied in a mysterious way by
                    guardian angels. And she thought of <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">her
                    helper</persName>, and whether he would be satisfied with her. Was she worthy of
                    all he had done for her? Not until this moment did it dawn upon her that she had
                    been placed at a post which she was not allowed to leave. And she vowed to
                    herself that nothing which had been sown in her personality should lie fallow.
                    Everything in her should sprout and blossom and become fruit, in her life and in
                    her work, in her art, which, as she now knew, was only waiting to be quickened
                    into vigorous life.</p>
                <p n="16">How she had fared up till now she had recorded in her diary. Her confessions were
                    almost completed. They were left behind in <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName>, in the shape of a bundle of foolscap covered with
                    writing. One day her confessions—and she smiled at this thought—would burst upon
                    mankind as the confessions of the first person who was not born unconsciously
                    through a mother's travail, but fully conscious through her own pangs.</p>
                <p n="17">She wanted to be a bridge-builder.</p>

                    thought that she had perhaps built a slender bridge across that abyss which

                <p n="21">And she smiled again when she thought of the dark girlish head of her pupil

                <p n="22">"<persName key="ruth" instant="false" full="yes">Ruth</persName>," she had then said to her pupil, "I owe it

                <p n="24">Then the train slowed down. She opened her eyes and looked out of the window:

                <p n="25">In feverish haste she put on her hat and coat. Slowly the train moved again, and

                    teeth in a frenzied effort to keep back the tears. No, she must not weep
                    now.</p>
                <p n="27">A few minutes later she was sitting in a car <pb n="305"/>

                    entered the portal of the home of her heart. Suddenly she hesitated, looked
                    around her, and for the first time a doubt assailed her. "Why have I come here
                    at all? And what do I want to ask him?" Thus she stood irresolute in the
                    grounds.</p>
                <p n="28">The rain had ceased. The white birch trees lifted their light, bright crowns to
                    the pale, watery sky. A couple of white-clad nurses nodded a greeting. Young
                    doctors in professional attire strode through <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the park</placeName>.
                    Pregnant women were strolling there: "Blue crocuses," she thought, with a
                    smile.</p>
                <p n="29">She remained standing and regarded the young women. Now she knew why she had

                <p n="30">A white-clad figure stood at the door which led to the private ward, and with a
                    cry of joy <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> threw herself into the motherly
                    arms of <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">the Matron</persName>. One nurse after another
                    came up, and they all rejoiced at the reunion.</p>
                <p n="31">Everything was unchanged.</p>
                <p n="32">
               <persName key="lili" instant="false" full="yes">Lili</persName> took <persName key="matron" instant="false" full="yes">the

                <p n="34">When she was tired out, she sat down in one of the large easy chairs in the long
                    corridor through the great folding doors of which fell a beam of greenish light.
                    Perhaps she would have to wait a long time.</p>
                <p n="35">She said the words to herself like a childish wish:</p>

                <p n="38">She waited. A blissful peace invaded her mind.</p>
                <p n="39">The folding doors opened. A slender figure in a white overall, with dark hair
                    over the lofty brow, came towards her.</p>
                <p n="40">Like a sleepwalker she let herself be led into <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the

                <p n="41">And she listened fascinated to the strange, muffled voice. She had quite
                    forgotten why she had come. She had forgotten everything she wanted to ask. She
                    could only say: "Yes, <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Professor</persName>."</p>
                <p n="42">Suddenly <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">Werner Kreutz</persName> looked at her

                    roused herself from her stupor. The secret anxiety which she could never banish
                    now gripped her, and, looking the while calmly into his eyes, she said:</p>

                    last word of my 'Confessions', 'I want so much to become a mother!' I feel
                    impelled to write you, my friend and father-confessor, at very great length. I
                    shall perhaps be somewhat prolix, but have patience with me. I have no time to
                    lose. In two days I shall be operated upon again.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p02">"You must sympathize with me in my desire for
                    maternity, to have a child, for I want nothing more ardently than to demonstrate
                    that <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> has been completely obliterated
                    in me—is dead. Through a child I should be able to convince myself in the most
                    unequivocal manner that I have been a woman from the very beginning.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p03">"Please understand me: the alienation from
                        <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> must inevitably crystallize into
                    the resolution to forget a person who, as <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, has been a tragic obstacle which prevented me from
                    experiencing all the mysteries and wonders which are part of the life of the
                    girl, the maid, and the woman, in the same way as all other members of my sex.
                    Because I lived a first life encased in a panser, from which I could not get
                    free, my youth as girl and maiden has been <pb n="309"/>

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> stolen from me, has been suppressed. This also
                    explains why then I returned to <placeName key="denmark" instant="false" full="yes">Denmark</placeName>
                    from <placeName key="germany" instant="false" full="yes">Germany</placeName>. The atmosphere of <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> felt most repellent. <placeName key="denmark" instant="false" full="yes">Denmark</placeName> was the stage on which <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> made his first appearance; it was his
                    home—for me, on the contrary, it was nothing less than a cast-off snake-skin.
                    Consequently, <placeName key="copenhagen" instant="false" full="yes">Copenhagen</placeName> was a very
                    difficult place for me to return to, because I had to fight not only for my
                    future, but against my past, which was really not my past at all, but the past
                    of an alien creature who had also robbed me of my home. <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, therefore, appears to me to-day in the light of a
                    usurper. For the same reason I find it hard to endure <placeName instant="false" full="yes">the
                        South</placeName> and <placeName instant="false" full="yes">West</placeName> of <placeName key="europe" instant="false" full="yes">Europe</placeName>, because everything there is bound up with <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' past. On the other hand, my love for
                        <placeName key="germany" instant="false" full="yes">Germany</placeName>, for <placeName key="berlin" instant="false" full="yes">Berlin</placeName>, and above all for <placeName key="dresden" instant="false" full="yes">Dresden</placeName>, is easy to understand; <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> did not know these cities, these landscapes and the
                    atmosphere of <placeName key="germany" instant="false" full="yes">Germany</placeName>, his acquaintance
                    with them being of the most cursory character when he was in a dying condition.
                    What a boon for me it was to be here, where it is only present and future for
                    me, and where there is no past connected with <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>! Here I have merely to fight for my future from the
                    basis of the present, unburdened by the painful past of another person.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p04">"But I must return to <placeName key="denmark" instant="false" full="yes">Denmark</placeName> in order to complete my 'Confessions', to

                    Danes in their coarser and more brutal manner (because they have only eyes for
                    the commonplace and the uncomplicated—they call it 'common sense' and the
                    'normal', because it is the most comfortable, and my countrymen are
                    intellectual, and not only intellectual but damnably comfortable), have
                    frequently asked me whether I could remember anything of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' erotic emotions. In putting this question
                    people touched me on the sorest point of my sensibilities, without their knowing
                    it. If Nature in alliance with the art of <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">my
                        Professor</persName> had not come to my assistance, so that I no longer felt
                    anything in my blood of these emotions of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, of the erotic sensations which he had experienced with
                    women, I should have felt defiled and befouled as a woman by this feeling of
                    alien sexual emotions.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p06">"I am fighting against the prepossession of
                    the Philistine who looks upon me as a phenomenon, as an abnormality. As I am
                    now, I am a perfectly ordinary woman among other women. The scepticism of the
                    Philistine, or rather the easy-going neighbours who only recognize the
                    commonplace as the justification of life, who invest me and my fate with the
                    quality of a sensation, often depresses me so severely that I find myself
                    wanting to die and playing with the idea of suicide.</p>

                    suicide, everybody would be right in saying that what had happened to me had
                    been contrary to Nature, an audacious challenge of the unnatural and the
                    artificial to the natural and to Nature; a creature born as an hermaphrodite
                    must remain an hermaphrodite, especially if it has lived as an hermaphrodite for
                    a lifetime. That without the operation performed by <persName key="kreutz" instant="false" full="yes">the

                    have proved by living for fourteen months. It may be said that fourteen months
                    is not much, but they seem to me like a whole and happy human life. The price
                    which I have paid seems to me very small.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p10">"If sooner or later I should succumb

                    steeled my strength in recent months, and often forced myself to do many things
                    which <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName> once did or perhaps did—yet I

                    not only as well as, but better than, <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>. I was often vexed to discover this, for it reminded me
                    of the virile qualities associated with <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p12">"Recently, a few days before my departure for
                        <placeName key="dresden" instant="false" full="yes">Dresden</placeName>, I looked over all the
                    photographs which had been taken of me in the <placeName key="womensClinic" instant="false" full="yes">Women's Clinic</placeName> a year ago. What a childishly simple and
                    effeminate expression all the pictures of that time reveal! How imploring and
                    helpless the glance! Then I looked in the mirror to see what I am like now. My
                    face has become smoother, and healthier, and fresher, the whole body more taut
                    and feminine. But my eyes have a self-conscious expression. I am not pleased at
                    this; life has hardened me.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p13">"Now I have returned once more. Here, where
                    the strong will of another stands between me and the outside world, as my
                    protector and defender, I can cast off the assumed sternness of my character. It
                    is not really sternness, but a very fragile shell around a completely
                    defenceless creature.</p>

                    of my whole character, of my endeavour and my deepest longing; all that I desire
                    is nothing less than the last fulfilment of a real woman; to be protected from
                    life by the sterner being, the husband. I think death would be more welcome to
                    me than, for instance, a life as artist, even as a great and
                    fêted<!--character appears in original--> artist on my own account. For I do not
                    want to be an artist, but a woman. Hence I must shut all artistic creation <pb n="315"/>

                    this during our last conversation—because I cannot continue the work of the
                    virile artist who was <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p15">"And in contrast to <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>, who had to create the works of art from inner
                    compulsion, my own life feels deflected from everything that constitutes art. Do
                    I make myself clear? It is not with my brain, not with my eyes, not with my
                    hands that I want to be creative, but with my heart and with my blood. The
                    fervent longing in my woman's life is to become the mother of a child. Whether
                    this wish can be fulfilled or not, the fact that I can openly acknowledge this
                    desire from the fullness of a pure woman's heart is an infinite happiness for
                    me. The fact that I may experience this happiness justifies everything that has

                    of narrative could I have chosen? I could not relate the story of <persName key="sparreAn" instant="false" full="yes">Andreas</persName>' life in the first person. Nor could I
                    employ the third person when speaking of my own life and experiences, after

                    everything. Hence, I often found it repugnant to speak of myself as of a third

                    striven in order to find the simplest and smoothest language for my

                    entries and descriptive extracts and letters, I had to write in such a short
                    time, between late autumn and spring, between two very serious operations, as if
