Maya Angelou worked as a cook, streetcar conductor, waitress, singer, dancer, editor, teacher, civil rights organizer, and actress before becoming one of America’s most beloved writers. Now 85 and a professor at Wake Forest University, she says her success as a storyteller stems from “seeing us as more alike than we are unalike”—that is, from finding universal themes.

Your latest book is about your mother. What did you learn from her?

To develop courage. And she taught me by being courageous herself. I realized that one isn’t born with courage. One develops it by doing small courageous things—in the way that if one sets out to pick up a 100-pound bag of rice, one would be advised to start with a five-pound bag, then 10 pounds, then 20 pounds, and so forth, until one builds up enough muscle to lift the 100-pound bag. It’s the same way with courage. You do small courageous things that require some mental and spiritual exertion.

Both she and your grandmother ran businesses. What did they teach you about good management?

That it’s wise to be fair, and it’s unwise to lie. That doesn’t mean tell everything you know. Just make sure that what you do say is the truth. There are people who say I’m brutally frank, but one doesn’t have to be brutal; one can tell the truth in such a way that the listener really welcomes it.
