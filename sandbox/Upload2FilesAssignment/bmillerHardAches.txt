The Hard Aches
WIDE AND WIRED 
You're looking fucking pretty tonight with your drug fueled smile and your eyes wide and wired 
Your pupils are as big as the sun, Your face is the deepest of red 
You're looking mighty pale but I've always had a thing for girls with untampered skin 
Where have you been sleeping? Have you been sleeping at all? 

Take me home with you 
I can't stand the lights or the stench of this room 
Crowds have always kinda freaked me out 

How is your brother doing? Is he still getting caught up in crime? 
How's your biggest little sister? You share a mouth, nose and eyes 
How's things at home? Do you still plan to plan to leave? 
You know you've always got a house and a home and a heart in me 
You've still got hands, You've got feet you could crawl and leave 
(Just ask me, I'm great at pretending) 

You and me were meant to be living self sufficiently hours from the city in a house on a hill that we'll build ourselves out of stick and of stone 
You and me were meant to be living self sufficiently hours from the city in a house on a hill that we'll build ourselves out of stick and of stone 

Maybe we've been drinking too much, maybe we don't get drunk together enough 
You're just as beautiful as you've always been, You're a sight to see and you're not aging half badly 
I look twice my age, I feel twice my age running circles at night round my couch and TV 
Nothings ever radiating from the screen except reruns of movies and shows I've already seen 
Maybe we've been drinking too much but baby we don't get drunk together enough 
You're just as beautiful as you've always been
