                <p>In 19310615, All items in brackets were written by Sigurd Wegener Thomson and are not translator insertions. Sigurd seems to have written in haste, leading to a number of mistakes, missing words, or incomplete sentences, which are noted when practical. The original letter includes notations and underlining in red and sometimes black, which most likely were added by Harthern.
In 19241200, One red and one blue line are drawn vertically down the left side of the page. Two red lines are drawn at the bottom of the page.</p>

                    <salute>Dear Ed. <persName key="harthernE">Harthern</persName>!</salute>
                    <p>Thank you for last time – and thank you for letting me borrow your book –
                        which I unfortunately forgot as a result of our interesting
                        conversation.</p>
                    <p>I had gotten the impression that you wanted to write the book rough and crude
                        – and it made me extraordinarily happy to see that you do not want that –
                        but make it real, true, and human – and <pb style="page" n="2"/> "Germanize"
                        the book's atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>I agree with you in your thinking about how the book
                        should be written – and am sincerely sorry that you are bound by an
                        unsatisfactory reason and by personal regard – because the book
                        should be written now.–-</p>
                    <p>I would like to help you as much as I can – by explaining her reactions
                        during the first time she was here in <placeName key="denmark">Denmark</placeName>, because I am quite sure about
                        your discretion.-–</p>
                    <p style="paraText" rend="division">x</p>
                    <p>Because I – as a doctor in waiting, have a great interest in the anatomical
                        and <pb style="page" n="3"/> physiological, I have some notes concerning
                        these matters – Since you pointed out that you were not interested herein I
                        will skip over them – or include them in an abbreviated form – if they will
                        contribute to understanding her psyche.-–</p>
