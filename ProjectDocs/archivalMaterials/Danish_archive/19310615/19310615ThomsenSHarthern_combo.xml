    <!-- In this sample TEI header, we have provided several different examples of how names and dates are to be represented. 
      For names used in the text, whether narrative or historical, the persName element gets the @key attribute with a value that
      should match their name in the Prosopography. For project team members and organizations use the @ref attribute 
      and the two-letter (or three-letter, if available in the info provided) initials of the person on the persName elements.-->

                    <salute>Dear Ed. <persName key="harthernE">Harthern</persName>!</salute>
                    <p>Thank you for last time – and thank you for letting me borrow your book –
                        which I unfortunately forgot as a result of our interesting
                        conversation.</p>
                    <p>I had gotten the impression that you wanted to write the book rough and crude
                        – and it made me extraordinarily happy to see that you do not want that –
                        but make it real, true, and human – and <pb style="page" n="2"/> "Germanize"
                        the book's atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>I agree with you in your thinking about how the book
                        should be written – and am sincerely sorry that you are bound by an
                        unsatisfactory reason and by personal regard – because the book
                        should be written now.–-</p>
                    <p>I would like to help you as much as I can – by explaining her reactions
                        during the first time she was here in <placeName key="denmark">Denmark</placeName>, because I am quite sure about
                        your discretion.-–</p>
                    <p style="paraText" rend="division">x</p>
                    <p>Because I – as a doctor in waiting, have a great interest in the anatomical
                        and <pb style="page" n="3"/> physiological, I have some notes concerning
                        these matters – Since you pointed out that you were not interested herein I
                        will skip over them – or include them in an abbreviated form – if they will
                        contribute to understanding her psyche.-–</p>

                                >Lili</persName> will live here. She is here in <placeName
                                    key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> to get her facial skin
                            feminized.</p>
                    <p style="LiliDiary">Her psyche is quite womanly - -</p>
                    <p style="LiliDiary"> - -. A weak point is her face. Her hair is: a wig! And her lower face is still masculine. – <pb style="page" n="4"/>
                            However, the brown eyes are decidedly womanly and quite beautiful, with
                            pretty eyebrows and lashes.</p>
                        <p>I took a walk in the garden – and along <placeName key="gentofter">Gentofte
                            lake</placeName>, and talked with her. Her human atmosphere is fully
                            feminine.</p>
                        <p>- - He and <persName key="wegenerG">Gerda</persName> had never really been
                            married: only been good friends and complemented each other.</p>
                        <p>[The description of <persName key="wegenerE">Einar's</persName> planned suicide.] This she told me in a silly tone, but I have the impression that <persName key="wegenerE">Bé</persName> was serious.-–</p>
