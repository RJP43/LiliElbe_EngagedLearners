                    <p>Thank you for last time – and thank you for letting me borrow your book –
                        which I unfortunately forgot as a result of our interesting
                        conversation.</p>
                    <p>I had gotten the impression that you wanted to write the book rough and crude
                        – and it made me extraordinarily happy to see that you do not want that –
                        but make it real, true, and human – and <pb style="page" n="2"/> "Germanize"
                        the book's atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>I agree with you in your thinking about how the book
                        should be written – and am sincerely sorry that you are bound by an
                        unsatisfactory reason and by personal regard – because the book
                        should be written now.–-</p>
                    <p>I would like to help you as much as I can – by explaining her reactions
                        during the first time she was here in <placeName key="denmark">Denmark</placeName>, because I am quite sure about
                        your discretion.-–</p>
                    <p style="paraText" rend="division">x</p>
                    <p>Because I – as a doctor in waiting, have a great interest in the anatomical
                        and <pb style="page" n="3"/> physiological, I have some notes concerning
                        these matters – Since you pointed out that you were not interested herein I
                        will skip over them – or include them in an abbreviated form – if they will
                        contribute to understanding her psyche.-–</p>

                        even flirts with it!</p>

                    <p style="LiliDiary">She loves to think herself a "trembling dove" persecuted by big, interested
