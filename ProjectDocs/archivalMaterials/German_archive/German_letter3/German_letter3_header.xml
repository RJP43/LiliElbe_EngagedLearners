   <!-- In this sample TEI header, we have provided several different examples of how names and dates are to be represented. For names used in the text, whether narrative or historical, the persName element gets the @key attribute with a value that should match their name in the Prosopography. For project team members and organizations use the @ref attribute and the two-letter (or three-letter, if available in the info provided) initials of the person on the persName/orgName elements. For dates notice there are some instances where exact dates are given and other places only month ranges are available. While in this template we have placed certain date formats in particular resp. statements, the matching is arbitrary and encoders should use whichever format fits the info provided for each resp. statement. -->

            <p>I observed that there is seems to be three different types of handwritings: 1. dark handwriting, 2. lighter handwriting, 3. red handwriting. The lighter handwriting seems to be the body of the letter. The darker handwriting seems to be headers/roman numerals. The red handwriting is written horizontally on top of the body of the letter. The letter is written on a white sheet of paper that has been folded in half, there is a small tear/fold over on the left side of the paper. The right bottom corner of the paper is folded over.</p>
            <p>I observed that this letter seems to be written in two different types of handwritings: 1. dark handwriting and 2. lighter handwriting. The lighter handwriting seems to be the body of the letter. Some things written in the lighter handwriting is crossed out. The darker seems to be headers/roman numerals. The letter is written on a white sheet of paper that has been folded in half, there is a small tear/fold over on the right side of the paper. The left bottom corner is folded over.</p>
