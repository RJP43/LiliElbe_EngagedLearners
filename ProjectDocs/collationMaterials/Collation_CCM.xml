<!-- RJP:2019-03-11: I commented out the vmachine schema momentarily until we can figure out how to allow placeName elements within p elements. Because Caroline is just starting out with XML I thought it be more worthwhile for her to have formedness checking and when the validity errors are present it can be a bit confusing. I suggest at our next meeting we reassociate the vmachine schema and comment out the TEI all schema to work through the errors as a team. -->
