                <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
                <p>To the reader unfamiliar with the unhappy byways of sexual pathology, the story
                    told in this book must seem incredibly fantastic. Incredible as it may seem, it
                    is true. Or, rather, the facts are true, though I think there is room for
                    differences of opinion about the interpretation of the facts.</p>
                <p>There would seem to be no doubt about the following points. <persName
                        key="wegenerE">A well-known Danish painter</persName>, whose identity is
                    shrouded in this book under the name of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas
                        Sparre</persName>, was born in the 'eighties of the last century. At about
                    the age of twenty he married, and was sufficiently normal both psychologically
                    and physically to be able to fulfil his functions as a husband. Some years later
                    a purely fortuitous happening led him to dress up as a woman, and the disguise
                    was so successful that he followed it by dressing up as a woman on several
                    occasions, on each of which those who were in the secret were surprised at his
                    apparent femininity. In fun, <persName key="larssen">one of his
                        friends</persName> dubbed him, when disguised as a woman, <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>. Gradually he began to feel a change taking place
                    in himself. He began to feel that "<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>" was a
                    real individual, who shared the same body as his male self— <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. The second personality, <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>, became more and more important, and <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> became convinced that he was a sort of
                    twin being, part male and part <pb n="11"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="vi"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="Introduction"/> female in the one body. He began to
                    suffer from disturbances every month in the shape of bleedings from the nose and
                    elsewhere, which he came to regard as representative of menstruation, and he
                    sought the help of many doctors, who, however, were unable to relieve him.</p>
                <p>He began to study books on sexual pathology and gradually came to the conclusion
                    that although his external organs were those of a male, and quite normal (though
                    perhaps rather undeveloped), yet his body contained in it the internal sexual
                    organs of a female in addition.</p>
                <p>Some of the doctors to whom he went thought him neurotic, some thought him
                    homosexual; but he himself denied the truth of both these diagnoses. One doctor
                    treated him with X-rays, and later on <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> attributed the shrunken state of the female sexual
                    organs which were found in his abdomen to the destructive effect of this X-ray
                    treatment.</p>
                <p>Gradually the female personality, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, took on
                    such importance that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> felt that,
                    unless in some way his male self could be made to give place to <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>, he could not go on living. By this time he was
                    in his forties, and his failure to find any doctor who could help him to realize
                    his desire to become a woman led him to the project of suicide if nothing should
                    happen within the next year.</p>
                <p>Just as things seemed at their worst he met <persName key="warnekros">a famous
                        German doctor from <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName></persName>,
                    who agreed that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was probably an
                    intermediate sexual type, furnished, by some sport of nature, with both male and
                    female gonads. He explained that <pb n="12"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="Introduction"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="vii"/> there were probably rudimentary ovaries in <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' abdomen, but that these were unable to
                    develop properly because of the inhibiting influence of the testicles which
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> also possessed.</p>
                <p>He proposed that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> should go to
                        <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>, where certain investigations
                    were to be undertaken. If these investigations confirmed his suppositions he
                    promised to remove <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' male organs and
                    transplant into him ovaries from a young woman, which would, as the work of the
                        <persName key="steinach">Steinach</persName> school had shown, activate the
                    rudimentary ovaries lying dormant in <persName key="sparreAn"
                    >Andreas</persName>' abdomen.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> went to <placeName key="berlin"
                        >Berlin</placeName>. The investigations confirmed <persName key="warnekros"
                        >the German doctor</persName>'s theory, and <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> embarked on a series of operations. The first one was
                    castration. His testicles were removed. A few months later he went to <placeName
                        key="dresden">Dresden</placeName>, where his penis was also removed, his
                    abdomen was opened, and the presence of rudimentary ovaries was established, and
                    at the same time ovarian tissue from a healthy young woman of twenty-six was
                    transplanted into him. A little later he underwent another operation, the nature
                    of which is not explained, though it had something to do with the insertion of a
                    canula.</p>
                <p>By this time he felt himself to be entirely a woman. The Danish authorities
                    issued him a new passport as a female in the name of <persName key="lili">Lili
                        Elbe</persName>, and <persName key="king">the King of Denmark</persName>
                    declared his marriage null and void. With his consent, and indeed at his
                    suggestion, <persName key="wegenerG">his former wife</persName> married
                        <persName key="portaF">a mutual friend</persName> of theirs in <placeName

                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and <persName key="wegenerG">his

                        >Lili</persName>, and proposed marriage to her.</p>
                <p>Before consenting to the marriage <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> made
                    another journey to <persName key="warnekros">the German surgeon at <placeName
                            key="dresden">Dresden</placeName></persName> to tell him that she had
                    received the offer of marriage and to ask him if he could carry out yet another
                    operation on her to enable her to function completely as a woman, to take the
                    female part in intercourse, and to become a mother. An operation for this
                    purpose was carried out; but shortly afterwards <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> died in <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName> of
                    heart trouble.</p>
                <p>There seems to be no question that the above statements are true. The case was
                    kept secret at first, but through <persName>a friend</persName>'s indiscretion
                    the secret leaked out, and the case was reported in the German and Danish
                    newspapers and caused a great sensation in the year 1931, some time before
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s death.</p>
                <p style="paraText" rend="division">. . . . .</p>
                <p>The story of this strange case has been written by <persName key="hoyerNiels"
                        >Niels Hoyer</persName>, partly from his own knowledge, partly from material
                    dictated by <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> herself, partly from <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>'s diaries, and partly from letters written by
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> and other persons concerned. <persName
                        key="hoyerNiels">The biographer</persName> states that <persName
                        key="warnekros">the surgeon who performed the operation</persName> has
                    passed his account of the case as correct.</p>
                <p style="paraText" rend="division">. . . . .</p>
                <p>The case falls within the domain of sexual pathology, and comes within the
                    category of sexual intermediacy. We are accustomed to classify individuals as
                    male or female, the classification <pb n="14"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="Introduction"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="ix"/> being made at birth by inspection of the external
                    genital organs. But modern sexology has pointed out the inadequacy of this rough
                    and ready classification. It must be remembered that in the early embryo it is
                    impossible, even by the most careful examination, to determine the sex.
                    Gradually a little eminence grows up which forms the rudiments of the sexual
                    organs. At first the rudiments of the organs of both sexes develop, but later
                    only one set continues developing, while the other set remains very rudimentary.
                    If development proceeds normally, the individual differentiates sufficiently to
                    be classified for all practical purposes as a male or as a female. But even in
                    the most normal and unambiguous individual, the rudiments of the organs of the
                    other sex are present throughout life. Thus the male possesses a rudimentary
                    uterus and the female a rudimentary penis. So far, we have been speaking of the
                    primary sexual organs, or genital organs.</p>
                <p>But there are a number of other, or secondary sexual characters (breasts, width
                    of pelvis, hair, etc.) which differ in the two sexes, and individuals who are
                    classified as male may have secondary sexual characters of a female type and
                    vice versa. When carefully investigated even the apparently most normal male may
                    be found to have certain physical sex characters approximating to the female
                    type, and the apparently most normal female to have sex characters approximating
                    to the male type. One is led to the conclusion that the hundred-per-cent male
                    and the hundred-per-cent female are theoretical types which do not exist in
                    reality.</p>
                <p>So far we have dealt only with the physical <pb n="15"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="x"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="Introduction"/> sexual characters, but there are
                    psychological sexual characters which differ as between the sexes, too.
                    Sometimes the presence of marked physical characteristics of the opposite sex is
                    not accompanied by any noticeable psychological intermediacy, or by any change
                    in the direction of sexual desire, i.e., by any trace of homosexual feeling. In
                    other cases some degree of homosexual feeling is present and in yet other cases
                    the sexual intermediacy is marked much more psychologically than it is
                    physically. For a full discussion of this subject the reader is referred to
                        <persName key="maranonGreg">Professor Gregorio Marañon</persName>'s book,
                        <hi rend="italics">The Evolution of Sex and Intersexual Conditions</hi>,
                    which is available in an English translation.</p>
                <p>Cases occur, though rarely, where an individual possesses the genital organs of
                    one sex, and in addition more or less complete genital organs belonging to the
                    other sex as well. Such anomalies are known as hermaphrodites, though in human
                    beings the hermaphrodism always seems to be incomplete. There is a small number
                    of curious cases of this sort recorded in sexological literature, though no
                    other case, so far as I know, has been so extreme, or so well recorded, as the
                    case of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>.</p>
                <p>Thus, when I was a medical student in <placeName key="sydney">Sydney</placeName>,
                        <placeName key="australia">Australia</placeName>, about the year 1912, a man
                    was admitted to the wards of my hospital suffering from regularly recurring
                    h&#230;morrhages, which were thought to be due to kidney disease. Investigation
                    showed that although his external genital organs were normal, and he was married
                    and able to perform the sexual act as a male, his body contained ovaries.</p>
                <pb n="16"/>
                <pb style="heading" rend="Introduction"/>
                <pb style="page" n="xi"/>
                <p>In <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName> in 1923, I saw, at the clinic of a
                    colleague, an individual who was apparently male, but who felt himself to be a
                    female just as <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> did. This patient,
                    too, had his male organs removed at his own request, and was given injections of
                    ovarian extract. No operation was ever undertaken to determine whether ovaries
                    were present in his body or not. I saw him—or her—again in 1926, after the
                    removal of the male organs, and quite recently I received a report about the
                    case. The individual is very unhappy, and has not succeeded in becoming
                    completely a woman.</p>
                <p><persName key="steinach">Professor Steinach</persName>, of <placeName
                        key="vienna">Vienna</placeName>, has for some decades been carrying on a
                    series of investigations into sexual physiology, and has had considerable
                    success in changing males into females and females into males among lower
                    animals, such as rats and guinea-pigs. He has even been successful in enabling a
                    formerly male rat to develop breast glands which function to the extent of
                    producing milk to nourish the litter of another rat; but up to the present he
                    has not succeeded in completing the transformation so that a former male could
                    become pregnant and give birth to a litter.</p>
                <p>Among birds, there are a number of cases on record where hens, which have laid
                    eggs and produced many chickens, have gradually changed their plumage, begun to
                    crow, and developed into cocks, and as cocks have fertilized other hens.</p>
                <p>But in human beings, although mild grades of sexual intermediacy are by no means
                    rare, cases like that of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>
                    arise but seldom; and I cannot help thinking that until we know more about
                    sexual physiology it is unwise to <pb n="17"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="Introduction"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="xii"/> carry out, even at the patient's own request, such
                    operations as were performed in this case. It would, I think, have been better
                    to try the effect of psychological treatment. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas
                        Sparre</persName> might either have been cured, or at least enabled to adapt
                    himself to life. By proper psychological treatment the duplication of
                    personality might have been resolved and he might have been enabled to lead a
                    reasonably happy life instead of embarking on a series of painful and dangerous
                    operations which ended only with his death.</p>

                    this book, except to say that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>

                    have arranged the papers she left behind in the form of this book. It is a
                    veracious life story, recorded by a person whose earthly course assumed the
                    shape of an unparalleled and incredible tragedy of fate, the life story of a
                    person whose afflictions were outside the range of our ordinary ideas.</p>

                <p>The scene is <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> in <placeName
                        key="quartierStgermain">the Quartier Saint Germain</placeName>. The time a
                    February evening in 1930. In a quiet street which harbours a stately palace
                    there is a small restaurant, whose regular customers are foreigners, and mostly
                    artists.</p>
                <p>Among them this evening were <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete Sparre</persName>, two Danish painters, and
                    their Italian friend <persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto Rossini</persName>, with
                    his elegant French wife <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>. The friends
                    had not seen each other for a whole year. One couple had been travelling in the
                    North, the other in the South of <placeName key="europe">Europe</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"Skaal!" cried <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, in the good old
                    Nordic way, and raised his glass. "This wine, children, is for the soul what
                    alpine sun is for the body. And this reminds me of a glorious legend of
                        <placeName key="cathedralSeville">the cathedral of Seville</placeName>,
                    which <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I were admiring a short
                    time ago. Under the plinth of the highest column they have immured a
                    sunbeam—that is the whole legend."</p>
                <p>"Splendid!" cried <persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName>, with
                    enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>"Heavenly, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>!" chimed in <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, warmly pressing his hand.</p>
                <p>And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> smiled happily and
                    thoughtfully.</p>

                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="rossiniEr"
                        >Ernesto</persName> exchanged a multitude of travel impressions—wanderings
                    through museums and disreputable alleys in <placeName key="cadiz"
                        >Cadiz</placeName> and <placeName key="antwerp">Antwerp</placeName>, voyages
                    of discovery through bazaars in <placeName key="balkans">the Balkans</placeName>
                    and in marine stores in <placeName key="hague">The Hague</placeName> and
                        <placeName key="amsterdam">Amsterdam</placeName>. Each tried to outdo the
                    other. Thus <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>; thus <persName
                        key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName>—completely absorbed in their subject,
                    their keen eyes alight with the enthusiasm of the artist.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was leaning attentive,
                    while <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> was whispering in his ear the
                    latest amusing, and even scandalous, anecdotes from <placeName key="rome"
                        >Rome</placeName> and <placeName key="madrid">Madrid</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"You are not drinking too much, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>?"
                    suddenly inquired <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, pausing in the
                    midst of one of the "latest" incredible stories, only to be related in a
                    whisper. . . . She had noticed the growing nervous excitement of her companion.
                    "You want to be fit and well to-night."</p>
                <p><persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName> and <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> caught up <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>'s
                    words. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> gazed mutely at <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. <persName key="rossiniEr"
                        >Ernesto</persName> took his friend's hand. "Is <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> causing you trouble again?" he inquired, full of
                    solicitude.</p>
                <p>"You've said it, <persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName>," replied <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> very seriously. "This condition is
                    gradually becoming intolerable. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> is no
                    longer content to share her existence with me. She wants to have an existence of
                    her own. I don't know whether you understand me. . . . I—I'm no longer any use.
                    Cannot do anything more. I'm finished. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> has
                    known this for a long time. That's how matters stand. And consequently she
                    rebels more vigorously every day. What shall I do with myself? The question may

                <p>"Bravo!" cried <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, not taking her eyes
                    off <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, who then rose wearily and made
                    for the bar.</p>
                <p>"Tell me quickly," whispered <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, looking
                    towards her friend, "how is your husband? I don't like his looks."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had lost her smile. "He has never been

                <p><persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName> and <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName> gazed silently at their friend.</p>
                <p>"I have almost given up all hope of saving him," said <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> very softly, "unless a miracle—"</p>
                <p><persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> interrupted her sharply. "Look here,
                    you're talking of a miracle." <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    regarded her friend inquiringly. "Well, listen. <persName key="kreutz">A very
                        good friend of ours</persName> is now in <placeName key="paris"

                        >Dresden</placeName>. He is a woman's doctor. He rang us up early to-day,
                    shortly after we had spoken to <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> on
                    the telephone. And then I thought at once: 'If anybody can help <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, it is <persName key="kreutz">this doctor
                        from <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName></persName>.' And the
                    matter is urgent, as <persName key="kreutz">the doctor</persName> must return to
                        <placeName key="germany">Germany</placeName> to-morrow afternoon. I will
                    make an appointment with him this evening."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> made a listless movement with her
                    hand. "Dearest <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, it is useless.
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> won't see any more doctors."</p>
                <p><persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> seized both <persName key="sparreGre"

                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> slowly lit a cigarette. She blew away
                    clouds of blue smoke and stared into the haze.</p>
                <p>Then she said slowly, without excitement, and distinctly.</p>
                <p>"Good, <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>; go and see <persName

                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> returned at this moment, holding up

                <p>When <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> were strolling at a later hour along <placeName>the
                        avenue near which <placeName>their studio</placeName> dwelling was
                        situated</placeName>, she avowed at first cautiously, but afterwards with
                    energy, what she had arranged with <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>.
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was beside himself. He stood
                    still in the middle of the road. He would not be examined either by a German or
                    by a French, or by an Indian mountebank. He was through with these
                    bloodsuckers.</p>
                <p>He had been ill for many years. Innumerable doctors and specialists had examined
                    him—without result. Now he was utterly tired. Life had become a torment to
                    him.</p>
                <p>Nobody understood what was wrong with him. But his sufferings were of the
                    strangest kind. <persName>A specialist in <placeName key="versailles"

                    this he was a perfectly normal man, who had only to behave reasonably like a man
                    to become perfectly well again; all that the patient lacked was the conviction

                <p>He had thought over everything, even the mode of his departure. It was to be, to
                    some extent, a polite obeisance to Nature. Now it was February. March and April

                <p>The only thing which tormented him, which pained him unspeakably, was the thought
                    of his wife—the loyal friend and companion of his life.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete Sparre</persName> was an artist of great talent.
                    Her pictures made an exciting and tingling impression, like a vapour from the
                    jungles of <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Perhaps because their marriage had been, above all, a comradeship almost from the
                    beginning, they both found life pleasant and worth while only when they were
                    together.</p>
                <p>They were hardly adult and were still attending <placeName key="academyArt">the
                            <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> academy of
                        art</placeName> when they had married. A few days before the wedding
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had sold his very first picture
                    at his very first exhibition. They had lived mostly abroad, chiefly in
                        <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>, and this life abroad had
                    contributed to strengthen the tie which bound them.</p>
                <p>It was therefore inevitable that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    frequently had moments when it seemed as if he were behaving like a traitor
                    towards <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. He had been forced to
                    recognize that he could work no longer, and he was apprehensive of becoming a
                    burden on <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. This thought had been
                    worrying him for months, poisoning the fount of his enjoyment.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was aware of his thoughts. Yet she
                    suspected that whatever she proposed to offer in the way of new hope would prove
                    futile. There were so many things that bound them together, so many struggles,
                    so many memories, bright and dark, and, perhaps most of all, <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>. For <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    was, in fact, two beings: a man, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>,
                    and a girl, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. They might even be called
                    twins who had both taken possession of one body at the same time.</p>

                <p>In character they were entirely different.</p>
                <p>Gradually <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> had gained such predominance over
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> that she could still be traced
                    in him, even after she had retired, but never the reverse. Whereas he felt tired
                    and seemed to welcome death, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was joyous and
                    in the freshness of youth.</p>
                <p>She had become <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s favourite model.

                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> felt herself to be the protectress of

                    <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. And <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> felt himself to be the protector of both. His ultimate
                    hope was to die in order that <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> might awaken
                    to a new life.</p>

                <p>The next morning <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> spoke affectionately
                    to him, pointing out lightly that he must call upon <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName> if for no other reason than as an act of courtesy. When
                    there he could always find an excuse if he could not bring himself to visit
                        <persName key="kreutz">her German Professor</persName>.</p>
                <p>An hour later he was on his way to <placeName key="passy">Passy</placeName>,
                    where <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> lived: punctually at twelve
                    o'clock her car stopped in front of the house where <persName key="kreutz">the
                        German doctor</persName> was staying. While <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName> was pulling the bell, <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> whispered: "Perhaps it will turn out quite interesting
                    to see <persName key="kreutz">your German celebrity</persName> face to face, as
                    he belongs to a race in whom interest in scientific investigation is so strongly
                    pronounced that this interest—"</p>
                <p>"For heaven's sake," interrupted <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>,
                    "don't start delivering a lecture on the doorstep."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> seized his friend's hand. "<persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, I only mean . . . I only hope . . . How
                    shall I express it?"</p>
                <p><persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> looked very seriously at her friend,
                    who was pale with excitement. "Go on, <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>."</p>
                <p>And then he blurted out: ". . . That he will not regard me merely as a sorry
                    renegade . . . because . . . I would rather be a woman than a man."</p>
                <p>"No, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, I will answer for that."</p>
                <p>Footsteps were heard inside the house.</p>
                <p>The door was opened and a servant received <pb n="28"/>

                    tall, thin gentleman advanced to meet them. A dark-blue <anchor type="refStart"

                    the austere elegance of his appearance in an almost military manner. His hair,
                    which was brushed in a smooth mass across his high forehead, was dark, while his
                    small moustache, trimmed in American style, was of a light fair colour.</p>
                <p>When <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> later on tried to recall these
                    features to memory his mind was a mere blank every time. From those blue,
                    deep-set eyes, which were bright and dark at the same time, radiated a strange,
                    captivating charm.</p>
                <p>It was <persName key="kreutz">Werner Kreutz</persName>.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> felt his heart beat faster. While
                        <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> was conducting them with a
                    somewhat ceremonious cordiality into the drawing-room, exchanging the while a
                    few words with <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, it occurred to
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> for the first time in his life
                    that German was a beautiful and musical language.</p>
                <p>As in a dream he listened to the conversation between the two, even when
                        <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> was telling <persName
                        key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> about him and his doleful story,
                    throwing him now and again, as if accidentally, a quick, affectionate
                    glance.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> could think of nothing, and was
                    conscious of nothing but the doctor's voice. It was as if he were laid under a
                    spell, the spell of this voice. It reminded him of <persName key="kreutz">the
                        Professor</persName>'s eyes; it, too, was light and dark at the same time.
                    Both the eyes and the voice penetrated into the innermost recesses of his
                    soul.</p>
                <p>And what would this voice have to say to him? <pb n="29"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="24"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> And these eyes, what would their glance
                    announce to him?</p>
                <p>A death sentence? Did he expect anything other than this? Did he expect anything
                    at all? Had he come here for any definite purpose?</p>
                <p><persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> stood in front of him, hardly
                    looked at him, and spoke only a few brief words to him. And <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> followed <persName key="kreutz">the
                        professor</persName> into an anteroom, where he was told to undress. "Now I
                    feel like a sleepwalker," thought <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> in
                    a vague and remote manner. He must obey, without questioning. He wanted to say
                    something, and fumbled for German words.</p>
                <p>"You need not give me any explanations, sir," <persName key="kreutz">the
                        Professor</persName> interrupted him considerately.</p>
                <p>"It hurts here, doesn't it, and there, and likewise there, doesn't it?" And his
                    hand slowly glided over <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' body. All
                    that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> needed to do was to nod quickly
                    and shyly. An almost terrifying astonishment gripped him. How did this strange
                    man know where his pains were located?</p>
                <p>And this astonishment grew into amazement when <persName key="kreutz">the
                        Professor</persName>, to whom <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> had
                    handed a bundle of photographs of <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, took the
                    portraits out of the envelope and laid them on the table in the order of the
                    years marked on their backs, which <persName key="kreutz">the
                        Professor</persName> had not observed.</p>
                <p>"There we have the development clearly marked," said <persName key="kreutz">the
                        Professor</persName> bluntly. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    did not even nod.</p>
                <p>"I hear you have had Röntgen

                    upon any existing ovaries . . . this must be disclosed by a further
                    examination."</p>
                <p>"Ovaries!" <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> almost shrieked. "Then . .
                    . I . . . have . . ." He could get no further. He could scarcely breathe from
                    excitement. Everything was going round.</p>
                <p>"Extremely probable," replied <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>,
                    imperturbable and positive; yet the sound of his voice seemed slightly muffled,
                    very soft and discreet. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was to be
                    reminded continually of this lightly veiled voice, and not merely <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. "For I think you possess both male and
                    female organs, and that neither of them has sufficient room to develop properly.
                    It is fortunate for you that you have such a pronounced feminine feeling. That's
                    why I think I shall be able to help you."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had to clutch at his heart. He leaned
                    over, in order not to miss a single word that fell from the lips of this amazing
                    man. He stared fixedly at him, expecting to find confirmation of his words in
                    his glance.</p>
                <p>"Well, <persName key="kreutz">Professor</persName>, what am I? . . . What . . .
                    ?"</p>
                <p><persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> rose, paced up and down the room
                    for a while as if to think the matter over, and then turned to <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> again. And once more <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> drank in his words.</p>
                <p>"Come to me in <placeName key="germany">Germany</placeName>. I hope I shall be
                    able to give you a new life and a new youth." </p>
                <p>These words were uttered with extreme simplicity.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> stood up and struggled for speech. </p>
                <p>"Then it will be <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> who survives?"</p>
                <p>"Yes," answered <persName key="kreutz">Werner Kreutz</persName>. "I will operate
                    on you, and give you new and strong ovaries. <pb n="31"/>

                <p>With these words ended the serious and fateful conversation between the strange
                    man and <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, who was still sitting a
                    little breathless when <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> brought
                        <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> into his consulting-room. And she
                    smiled to conceal her emotion.</p>
                <p><persName key="kreutz">The doctor</persName> stood apart from them thoughtfully,
                    and looked suddenly at <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and then at
                        <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>. "May I speak quite openly?" he
                    said, glancing from one to the other.</p>
                <p>"Please do," replied <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. "I have no
                    secrets from <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>."</p>
                <p>"Well, then," began <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>, "I hear that
                    you are married."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> blushed with embarrassment.</p>
                <p>"Your marriage . . . perhaps you can tell me something about it, because, as a
                    doctor, at any rate . . ."</p>
                <p>Each of them was conscious of something fantastic at this moment, although the
                    question seemed the most natural thing in the world.</p>
                <p>"Perhaps I had better go," suggested <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>,
                    full of solicitude for her friend.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> caught hold of her. "No, <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, no, don't go."</p>
                <p><persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> came to the assistance of both.
                    His smile worked at this moment like a deliverance. "What is the attitude, for
                    instance, of—I thought I heard the name <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    just now—well, of <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, towards men? I mean, do

                <pb style="page" n="27"/>
                <p>"Yes, indeed," laughed <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>; "it is
                    positively incredible what an attraction <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    has for the other sex."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> attempted to interrupt her. <persName
                        key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> was now laughing heartily.</p>
                <p>"Let the lady go on, please." And <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had
                    perforce to listen while she continued: "I have seen it with my own eyes at
                    various carnivals and balls." </p>
                <p><persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> became serious again. "What you
                    have just told me, madam, is all of a piece with the picture I have formed in my
                    own mind. . . . For the rest, the operation which has become necessary,
                    especially as it is the first of its kind, will create a number of remarkable
                    situations, not least, from a legal point of view. But"—and with this he came
                    close to <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and took his hand—"I
                    promise you I will not leave <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> in the lurch
                    and that I will assist her with her first independent steps into life." </p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> looked down at the stranger's hand.
                    He did not know what he ought to do. He looked helplessly around the room, then
                    released the doctor's hand and stretched out both arms to <persName
                        key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>, as if imploring help. She hurried to him
                    and embraced him maternally.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>," he stammered through his tears,

                <p>For hours <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had been waiting in
                        <placeName>the little studio</placeName> for her husband's return.</p>
                <p>When at last he entered, he was as pale as death. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> hurried to him. She led him to the sofa, upon which he
                    collapsed helplessly. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> remained
                    sitting by him for a long time without saying a word.</p>
                <p>When at length <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> began to speak, she
                    listened to him with closed eyes, and <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> too spoke with closed eyes. How much of it all was a
                    dream? And how much reality? Did that which was then beginning mean redemption,
                        <hi rend="italics">the</hi> redemption? Whither led the way for him, for
                    her, for both?</p>
                <p>And <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, completely upset by all that he
                    had just experienced, told his story in broken words.</p>
                <p>At length he rose to his feet. Without a word he took <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>'s hands and led her to the easel in front of the broad
                    window, through which the northern sky was lighting up the room. A large picture
                    was leaning against the easel, upon which three female figures were to be seen.
                    One of the women bore <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s features,
                    another bore <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>'s features, and the
                    third figure bore <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' —<persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>'s features!</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>," he then said, "be thankful that you

                <p>Not until then did he dare to acknowledge to himself how great his torment and
                    despair had been during these last years. Now he could be frank with himself.
                    Now he <hi rend="italics">must</hi> be. . . . Yet he badly needed help, but had
                    a friend who would assist him, <persName key="brotherChris">his

                        >Lili</persName>. From time to time I have been examined by several doctors,
                    but without result. Throughout they prescribed sedative remedies, which left me
                    no better nor wiser than I was before. For I want to know what is happening to
                    me, even if it hurts. After consulting with <persName key="sparreGre"

                    sounds almost like a miracle! I had a consultation with the famous surgeon and

                    time, and then declared that my case was so rare that only one similar case had
                    been known up till now. He added that in the condition in which I am at present,
                    I could hardly be regarded as a living creature, because the ray treatment had
                    been a great mistake, especially as it had not been preceded by microscopical
                    examination. Now he fears that this treatment in the dark may have destroyed my
                    organs—male as well as female. Consequently, he wants me to go to <placeName

                    in all the important Salons. But now all this is over. I am no longer fit for
                    anything. I am like a wretched grub which is waiting to become a butterfly. The
                    operation is urgent, and <persName key="kreutz">the doctor</persName> would like
                    me to proceed to <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName> immediately, as some

                    I am to take, in order to support the internal organs and thereby keep me alive

                <p>A few days later, on a Monday morning, <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>
                    received a telegram from a friend in <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>

                <p>Since the arrival of the telegram he had scarcely uttered a word. He seemed like

                <p>He looked out, as if he were seeking them: <placeName key="paris"
                        >Paris</placeName> . . . <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> . . .
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>When farewells were being said he had not once leaned out of the window. . . .
                        <placeName key="eiffel">The Eiffel Tower</placeName> . . . the mirage in the
                    sky of the towering dome: <placeName key="sacreCoeur">Sacré Cœur</placeName>. .
                    . <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName>. . . <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>. . . all had vanished for ever.</p>
                <p>For ever? Yes, for ever! And he, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas
                        Sparre</persName>, would never return to <placeName key="paris"
                        >Paris</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Perhaps another being. . . . He was unable to pursue the thought to its end. <pb

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>

                    <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> . . . <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName> . . . <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>. . . . This
                    triad accompanied him, the fugitive. Now he heard it suddenly in the rhythm of
                    the train: fugitive . . . fugitive. . . . </p>
                <p>The train raced through <placeName key="franceNorthern">northern
                        France</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Across the landscape new townships were springing up out of the ruins. Here and
                    there were vast, strange-looking rectangles with fantastic crops. They were not
                    cornfields: they were fields of crosses, soldiers' cemeteries, plantations of
                    the dead. Cross set close to cross as far as eye could see.</p>
                <p>And he thought of <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Why had he not
                    allowed her to accompany him? She had implored him to do so. And yet he had
                    forced her to remain behind in <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> . . .
                    and to wait. He pulled himself together, lit a cigarette, and put the thought
                    out of his mind.</p>
                <p>The train reached the frontier between <placeName key="france">France</placeName>
                    and <placeName key="belgium">Belgium</placeName>. He gazed indifferently out of
                    the window. The last seat in the compartment was now occupied.</p>
                <p>Through <placeName key="belgium">Belgium</placeName> the train crawled at a
                    snail's pace. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> strolled up and down
                    the dining-car and mixed a cocktail. It was not yet six o'clock. The train
                    stopped at every tiny village. Passengers alighted and entered in a leisurely
                    way, as if they had endless time on their hands.</p>
                <p>Then <placeName>the German frontier</placeName> was reached, and a new engine
                    imparted new energy to the journey. Slowly the night descended, and soon the
                    train was rushing through the darkness.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had lingered over his meal in the
                    dining-car and had drunk more wine than usual to deaden his feelings and lull
                    the pain caused him by the <pb n="41"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="36"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> vibration and rolling of the train. But he must
                    return to his compartment. He could scarcely keep on his feet. At length he sank
                    back in his corner again, clenched his teeth, and closed his eyes. All his
                    bridges were burned. Everything lay behind him. His whole life seemed to him to
                    be something that was past, something that was lost.</p>
                <p>He resolved not to think. But his brain gave him no rest. Would it not perhaps be
                    best to abandon this fantastic experiment? For what it was proposed to do to him
                    was only an experiment after all. Would it not have been more rational to live
                    out his life to the end as it was shaped for him, to let this life ebb away from
                    him?</p>
                <p>He thought of the letter which he had lately written to <persName key="kreutz"
                        >Werner Kreutz</persName>:</p>
                <p>"Yours for life and death, provided <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    survives."</p>
                <!--DRR 3-2-18, we added this as a letter though we need to check against the collation spreadsheet. RJP 2018-03-12,confirmed that should be just a paragraph because while reference to a quote in a letter it is not an actual letter.-->
                <p>Every particle of masculine pride that dwelt in him stirred and gripped him. "I
                    must reach the goal. I must hold out." He spoke his thoughts half aloud, and
                    several fellow-travellers regarded him inquiringly.</p>
                <p>He had to laugh. . . . Not in vain was he a native of <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName>, where nothing is ever taken seriously.</p>
                <p>"So," said <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> to himself, "let us write
                    our obituary. It's not a matter to be taken tragically."</p>
                <p>And then he began rapidly to compose the sort of notice that would be published,
                    appraising him as artist.</p>
                <p>"The painter <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> is dead. He died
                    in the train between <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> and <placeName
                        key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>. His <pb n="42"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="37"/> fellow-travellers thought he had fallen asleep in one
                    of the corner seats of his compartment. The cause of death was probably a heart
                    attack.</p>
                <p>"A happy and harmonious artistic life here came to an abrupt close. He was a man
                    in the prime of life. After searching for a long time and experimenting in
                    various ways, he seemed to have found his style. His pictures, which mostly
                    originated in <placeName key="france">France</placeName> and <placeName
                        key="italy">Italy</placeName>, were sometimes bright and bathed in colour,
                    sometimes dark and somewhat sombre, but always charged with sentiment and
                    natural feeling. Two subjects he preferred above all else: <placeName
                        key="paris">Paris</placeName>, whose embankments, bridges, and towers he
                    succeeded, with no little mastery, in reproducing in their lightly veiled
                    pearl-grey atmosphere, and landscapes under lowering skies, showing in vivid
                    lights the trees and houses in the background. It was especially in pictures of
                    the latter kind, these strong, very masculinely conceived storm pictures, that
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> found an outlet for his
                    talent.</p>
                <p>"We, who were acquainted with his soft, often effeminate appearance, and his
                    laughing, joyous tones in conversation, noted this with astonishment, and the
                    thought frequently struck us that whatever masculine force resided in him found
                    its outlet in these strong, somewhat wild and wilful pictures.</p>
                <p>"He painted very quickly, and thus it happened that he found time to devote
                    himself to many other things beside his art. His knowledge was really
                    comprehensive. Very characteristic was an answer which we once heard from his
                    own lips, in <placeName key="trianon">the Trianon</placeName>, addressed by him
                    to an older <pb n="43"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="38"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> colleague. The latter had expressed his
                    annoyance at the fact that a young colleague was beginning a picture in what he
                    thought was too systematic a way. 'You must pardon me if I don't share your
                    view,' retorted <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>, 'but I do
                    believe that it is impossible to paint a leaf of a rose correctly unless one
                    knows the last thing about the influence of Assyrian bas-relief upon the
                    sculpture of the Greeks.'</p>
                <p>"On another occasion he expressed himself in the following way: 'I cannot
                    understand how lightly most of my older colleagues take their art—how easily
                    satisfied they are with their performances. As for me, I calculate I should
                    require a thousand years to become a decent painter.' Thus seriously did
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> take his art, at any
                    rate.</p>
                <p>"The greater portion of his life he had spent far from his Danish home—in
                        <placeName key="italy">Italy</placeName>, <placeName key="holland"
                        >Holland</placeName>, <placeName key="germany">Germany</placeName>, and
                        <placeName key="france">France</placeName>. He lived mostly in <placeName
                        key="paris">Paris</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"The reason why he turned his back in early manhood on <placeName
                        key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>, although his art was highly
                    appreciated there from the beginning, was because <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName> and <placeName key="denmark">Denmark</placeName> did
                    not seem to him to be the right soil for his wife's art. In <placeName
                        key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> he had frequently been obliged to
                    hear how much his pictures were preferred to those of his wife. And that was
                    perhaps the worst thing that could be said to him. In <placeName key="paris"
                        >Paris</placeName>, where the contrary was generally the case, he felt at
                    home for this very reason. He felt his wife's successes as his own successes,
                    for his dominant characteristic was chivalry towards his wife, as towards women
                    generally.</p>
                <p>"For the rest, his was a complex, enigmatic <pb n="44"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="39"/> nature. Despite the inevitable influences to which
                    every artist in <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> is exposed, he remained
                    fundamentally a Northern painter, and his art, in its quintessence, had little
                    affinity with Latin, but every affinity with Teutonic influences. His personal
                    outlook was European. He maintained a constant intercourse with French
                    philosophers and writers, with Polish violinists, with Russian architects, and
                    German painters.</p>
                <p>"In collaboration with <persName key="guyot">a French friend</persName> he wrote
                    a book about Northern sagas, which passed through many editions in <placeName
                        key="paris">Paris</placeName>. Of this he was not a little proud. And he
                    took pleasure in the fact that through this book he had been the means of
                    opening the eyes of the Latin reading world to the Teutonic world of ideas, an
                    undertaking which in the post-War period (the book appeared in the year 1924)
                    deserves praise as the throwing of an intellectual bridge between the Latin and
                    the Teutonic worlds.</p>
                <p>"Without being himself a practised musician, he cherished a deep love of
                    music.</p>
                <p>"In recent years his health had not been particularly good. He had frequently
                    complained of pains, but always in a restrained and smiling way, so that even
                    the doctors whom he was eventually obliged to consult were misled as to his real
                    condition or were unable to realize the serious state of his health.</p>
                <p>"And now death has so abruptly—and to the deep sorrow of his many friends near
                    and far—terminated this versatile artistic career, which to all of us who have
                    known him must seem like an unfinished romance. . . ."</p>

                <p>"Full stop," said <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> to himself. "Full
                    stop." And he thought that, in much the same language as he had just been using,
                    someone else had secretly written down his career in a diary—<persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, his faithful life's companion, as she too
                    thought that he would die suddenly. One night he had found her asleep over her
                    diary. He was careful not to let <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    suspect that he knew of the existence of this diary.</p>
                <p>The train had passed <placeName key="aix">Aix</placeName> long ago. Would they
                    never reach <placeName key="cologne">Cologne</placeName>? he moaned
                    inwardly.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had not booked a sleeping-berth. He
                    did not care for this modern travelling comfort. To be perched aloft with
                    perfect strangers was repellent to his fastidiousness. An unconquerable aversion
                    forbade him to undress in the presence of other men. He had often been chaffed
                    on this account. Only <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> understood his
                    repugnance.</p>
                <p>At last, <placeName key="cologne">Cologne</placeName>! All his fellow travellers
                    left the compartment. "They have sleeping-berths," thought <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> gleefully. He was left alone.</p>
                <p>After a short time the train started again. <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> lit a fresh cigarette. Would the pain leave him in peace
                    until he reached his destination, <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>? If
                    he could only sleep just this one night! If he could only banish thought for
                    just this one night!</p>
                <p>He took off his coat and laid it under his head, so that he might lie higher, and
                    wrapped himself in his cloak. Before he had felt too hot . . . now he began to
                    shiver. He rose from his seat, drew down the curtains in front of the windows,
                    and switched off the light. Then he laid down again.</p>
                <p>The pains racked him afresh. He drew his cloak over his face.</p>

                <p><persName key="bride">A lady</persName><!--unknown--> was standing in front of the door. Her

                <p>The darkness in his compartment seemed for a moment to intimidate her. But only
                    for a moment. Then she threw a small trunk upon the rack and sank wearily into

                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> switched on the light again.</p>
                <p>He suppressed his ill-humour at being thus suddenly jerked out of his solitude.
                    "The train will not stop again until it reaches <placeName key="berlin"
                        >Berlin</placeName>," he thought, "and so there is no hope of being alone
                    again." Should he move into the adjoining compartment? Perhaps it was empty. But
                    he immediately rejected the idea. He could not hurt the lady's feelings by
                    appearing discourteous.</p>
                <p>He sat up straight in his seat, and observed his companion without her noticing
                    it.</p>
                <p>What struck him was the expression of her eyes. She did not seem to be seeing him
                    at all; she did <pb n="49"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="42"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> not seem to be aware that she was sharing the
                    tiny compartment with a man.</p>
                <p>He looked in front of him. He stared at his fingers. But his eyes were soon fixed
                    on her again, and he noted with astonishment that she was weeping.</p>
                <p>The tears were starting from her eyes. She must have seen that he was looking at
                    her; but in spite of this she did not make the least attempt to hide her weeping
                    or dry her tears.</p>
                <p>She was obviously quite young. Plaits of fair hair framed a smooth, narrow,
                    girlish forehead. Her eyes, dimmed with tears, were bright blue and at other
                    times could sparkle with gaiety. She had removed her gloves. He noticed a plain
                    ring on a finger of her left hand. She was a bride, then.</p>
                <p>Profound sympathy stirred in him.</p>
                <p>"Mademoiselle . . ." he began.</p>
                <p>She did not seem to hear him. Probably he had spoken too softly, or the roar of
                    the train had drowned his words.</p>
                <p>Then it occurred to him that he was now in <placeName key="germany"
                        >Germany</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"Gnädiges Fräulein . . ." he repeated, almost embarrassed.</p>
                <p>She raised her weeping eyes. "What an enchanting bride!" thought <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>"I should like so much to help you," he said. "You seem to be in great trouble. .
                    . ."</p>
                <p>He could get no further. She covered her face with her hands and wept as if her
                    heart would break. Then, between her sobs, she handed him a folded newspaper,
                    which she had been hugging the whole time. Only then did <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> notice it. He <pb n="50"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="43"/> took the paper, but did not know what to do with it.
                    He rose from his seat and sat beside the weeping girl and stroked her hand. She
                    became calmer.</p>
                <p>It appeared that <persName key="pianistXX">her husband, a well-known
                        musician</persName>, had gone to <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>
                    two days before in order to give a concert in that city. This very evening he
                    had been expected to return. On the way to <placeName>the station</placeName> to
                    meet him, she had chanced to buy a newspaper, <hi rend="italics">the</hi>
                    newspaper which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was now holding in

                <p>She pointed to the place on the front page and wept again.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> read:</p>
                <!-- RJP:2018-10-01: Text appears smaller. -->

                            >Hanover</placeName></persName>, who gave a successful concert yesterday
                    evening in the <placeName>XX hall</placeName>, met with an accident on the way
                    to his hotel, his taxi-cab colliding with a tramcar. He is now lying in
                        <placeName>hospital</placeName><!--in german as xxclinic--> with very
                    serious injuries. His condition gives rise to the gravest anxiety. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was shocked when he read the report.
                    He had offered his help to <persName key="bride">the unhappy bride</persName>. Now he felt
                    like an idle chatterer.</p>
                <p>And yet, little as he had ever been able to help himself, in the case of others
                    he had frequently been able to alleviate pain by means of a mystic force which
                    appeared to dwell in him. How often had not <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> and <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> assured him
                    of this?</p>
                <p>The young lady's feverish hands were now lying in his. He clasped them tightly
                    for a long time. At first she quivered like a captive bird. Then the quivering
                    grew less and less. He did not utter a word; he merely stroked very softly the
                    limp, girlish hands. She too was silent. He could hear her <pb n="51"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="44"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> gentle breathing, and then her breathing became
                    more and more regular. Her head sank on his shoulder, and she fell asleep. Now
                    her heart was beating softly against his hand, which he had been obliged to
                    place around her to afford her support.</p>
                <p>And he smiled happily at the thought that something of that hidden enigmatic
                    force was still left in him to-day.</p>
                <p>More than once he tried to move; but each time his companion trembled like a sick
                    child, whimpering in slumber. He therefore remained sitting in a rigid position.
                    And gradually the roar of the train rocked him lightly to sleep also.</p>
                <p>It was not long before he awoke, and the thought of his position forced a smile
                    to his lips.</p>
                <p>Here he was now sitting, he, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>,
                    of <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>, whom life had drifted to
                        <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>, and who was now being driven
                    northward by a fantastic destiny, overwhelmed with his own grief and needing
                    help and assistance if ever a person did, and chance had selected just him to
                    give consolation to a perfect stranger, to help her over a dark hour of her
                    existence—<!-- RJP:2018-02-02: Note from Emily on 2016-10-26: "Check: It looks like a smudge in the scan; check original"-->
                    perhaps her darkest hour. And here was <persName key="bride">this little German
                        lady</persName>, the wife of <persName key="pianistXX">an unknown
                        man</persName>, lying in his arms. And she and he, each of them, were
                    journeying, guided <choice>

                    </choice> some blind providence, towards their own fates . . . somewhere in
                        <placeName key="germany">Germany</placeName>.</p>
                <p>These were the thoughts that kept running through his mind.</p>
                <p>And then a few secret tears splashed down his cheeks, and it suddenly dawned upon
                    him why all this had so happened. <persName key="bride">This charming creature from
                            <placeName key="hanover">Hanover</placeName></persName>, who was now

                    <pb style="page" n="45"/> in his arms like a blissfully confiding child, had
                    been sent him as the last woman towards whom he could act as a protective
                    male—before parting for ever from woman, from the eternal-feminine.</p>
                <p>So his thoughts assumed these vague shapes, while on the other side of the window
                    a foggy morning was dawning, and the train was rushing through the sea of houses
                    which constituted <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>.</p>
                <p>He realized that he must awaken his travelling companion.</p>
                <p>With a shriek of anguish she started out of her sleep, and gazed at him in utter
                    perplexity. "Oh, he can't be dead!" Her words again dissolved in tears.</p>
                <p>"Child," he said, speaking in a soft and confident voice, "child, I do not know
                    your name, and you do not know mine, but please believe me when I say that I
                    know he is alive."</p>
                <p>She seized both his hands and covered them with kisses.</p>
                <p>"Yes, indeed," he assured her, "make your mind quite easy."</p>
                <p>"Oh, I am quite at ease! How you have helped me! I shall never forget what you
                    have done."</p>
                <p>A few minutes later she was lost in the crowd of people on the platform.
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> gazed after her for a long time.
                    The newspaper which she had given him during the night was the only memento
                    which he retained.</p>
                <p>A few days later <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> happened to read in
                    a newspaper that <persName key="pianistXX">the husband of <persName key="bride">his unknown
                            travelling companion</persName></persName> was on the road to

                <p>In the company of <persName>a porter</persName>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> walked the short distance from
                        <placeName>the station</placeName> to <placeName>the hotel</placeName>. </p>
                <p>"How devilish cold it is here in <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>,
                    although it is the first of March!" he confided in a tone of surprise to the man
                    who was carrying his two trunks. "In <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> it
                    is already spring." </p>
                <p>"Yes, in <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>," replied the honest fellow,
                    "in <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>." And this ended the
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> turned up his collar. His teeth were
                    really chattering. He was exhausted after passing an almost sleepless night and
                    plunging into the midst of a strange world. But the unexpected coldness of the
                    temperature kept his senses fully alert.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, before he reached the neighbouring hotel, the thought struck him:
                    "These two trunks contain my very last articles of clothing, shirts, collars. .
                    . . How absurd!"</p>
                <p>A feeling of defiance welled up in him, as if the <hi rend="italics">man</hi>
                    were at bay, the man within him.</p>
                <p>In <placeName>the hotel</placeName>, where the manager had been advised of his
                    arrival, he was treated with exquisite courtesy. He immediately inquired whether
                        <persName key="kreutz">Professor Kreutz</persName>, who was in the habit of
                    staying in <placeName>this hotel</placeName> almost every week-end, had
                    perchance already arrived. He was disappointed to learn that this was not so,
                    nor had any letter been left for him with the porter.</p>

                <p>A few minutes later he went to his room. He took a warm bath, and by the time he
                    had breakfasted all his troubles were forgotten.</p>

                        friend</persName>, the sender of the fateful telegram which had prompted his
                    journey to <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>, soon rang him up.</p>
                <p>"Welcome to <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>," her voice sounded over
                    the telephone. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> immediately
                    recognized the voice of <persName key="schildtBar">Baroness Schildt</persName>,
                    whom he had met in <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> on a number of
                    occasions with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and their two
                    friends.</p>
                <p>"We have everything ready. And so that no time may be lost, some specialists whom

                <p>Some minutes later, <persName key="arns">Professor Arns</persName>, a doctor whom
                    he had never heard of before, made an appointment with him for twelve
                    o'clock.</p>
                <p>And scarcely had this visit been arranged than the telephone rang again.
                        <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels Hvide</persName>, an old <placeName

                    years, called him up.</p>
                <p>"Hullo, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>."</p>
                <p>"How do you know that—"</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> sent me a long telegram yesterday,

                <p>An address and directions were hastily written down. A few minutes afterwards
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was on his way, and half an hour
                    later he was in his friend's house.</p>

                <p>A splendid fellow, this <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>—a blond giant
                    from <placeName key="jutlandNorth">North Jutland</placeName>, where his family
                    were old landed proprietors.</p>
                <p><persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName>, his wife, was the type of the modern
                    cultivated woman. Henna-red hair contrasted piquantly with her large blue eyes.
                    Both were globe-trotters. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had often undertaken long
                    journeys with them together. Intimate as they had all been with one another,
                    however, <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> and his wife had hitherto
                    been unaware of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' secret.</p>
                <p>He was received most cordially. They had breakfast and spoke about indifferent
                    subjects as long as <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> was in the room.
                    Then <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> blurted out:</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> has told me something which I can't

                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> retorted. "No; the letter is
                    addressed to you."</p>
                <p>On the walls of the room hung a few pictures, painted by <persName

                        >Andreas</persName> looked up at them. The first picture, painted by

                        >Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Yes," said <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> delicately, "now I
                    understand a good deal of what used to seem like a fantastic idea about you
                    both—seeing you crop up so often as a female model in <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>'s pictures."</p>
                <p>A brief silence followed this remark.</p>
                <p>"Well, old fellow," resumed <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>, "some
                    hints which <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> let fall about you a year

                    appeared to be taking a strange turn. Whether the change that is now in store

                    entrusted your fate here to the best and most conscientious hands. Everything
                    now depends upon whether you will have the strength to go through with it. You
                    seem tired. But"—and <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> laughed
                    merrily—"it really is a most extraordinary thing for a man to be faced with the
                    choice of whether he will survive in this world of multiplying sensations as
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, or"—and then he pointed to the
                    picture—"as <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> looked

                    at his friend. "Faced with the choice, you say. . . . No, I do not think it is a
                    question of that, but of something much more serious, of life or death, in fact;
                    for believe me, the man you are talking to is condemned to death. And now the
                    question is, whether that <hi rend="italics">being</hi> there"—and he pointed to
                    the portrait—"can be summoned into existence and take up the battle of
                    life."</p>
                <p><persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> now spoke very seriously. "Yes, and
                    what seems to be the most important thing at the moment is that you should be
                    perfectly clear in your own mind how this strange, fantastic change which you
                    have been undergoing from childhood until now—that is, during a normal human
                    life—has been proceeding; in what gradual manner, therefore, <persName

                <p>"That is so," replied <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, looking at his
                    watch; "but now I must be off to my first arbiter of life and death, to
                        <persName key="arns">Professor Arns</persName>. And when I have finished
                    with him I must probably go further . . . through the whole round."</p>
                <p>"Agreed," laughed <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> jovially; "and when

                <p style="paraText" rend="division">. . . . .</p>
                <p><persName key="arns">Professor Arns</persName>, the inventor of a new method of
                    blood-testing, received <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> in a very
                    considerate manner. He put a series of questions which, although of a delicate
                    nature, were answered by <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> without the
                    least hesitation.</p>
                <p>During the long and elaborate examinations— (the main thing was to determine the
                    vital condition of <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> in <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> by an analysis of his blood)—<persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> exerted all his will-power to exclude
                    thought. The doctor conducted him from the study into a comfortably furnished
                    room. "If you would like to smoke, please do so," he said. After chatting for a
                    short time about unimportant things, <persName key="arns">Professor
                        Arns</persName> intimated to his patient that he must now submit himself for
                    a special examination by his friend <persName key="hardenfeld">Dr.
                        Hardenfeld</persName>, the sexual psychologist. "My colleague <persName
                        key="hardenfeld">Hardenfeld</persName> has had so much experience in the
                    more 'emotional' sphere—whatever we may think of this from the scientific
                    standpoint—that I, at any rate, cannot ignore his opinion in what may so
                    specially affect your person. When they have dismissed you there, you will have
                    to go to <persName key="karner">Dr. Karner</persName>, another colleague. He and

                        key="lili">Lili</persName>. In any case I shall be glad if you will call on
                    me again to-morrow morning. The result of these various 'tests' to which we have

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="51"/> will then be forwarded to your protector, <persName
                        key="kreutz">Professor Kreutz</persName>."</p>
                <p>"Your protector." . . . These words made <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' heart beat faster, and when, shortly afterwards, he was
                    sitting in a waiting-room of the spacious <placeName key="institutePsychiatry"
                        >Institute for Psychiatry</placeName>, he was obliged to keep repeating
                    these two words to himself—otherwise all his courage would have oozed away. "Why
                    have I been sent here?" he wondered. "What have I to do here?" He felt intensely
                    uncomfortable. In this large room a group of abnormal persons seemed to be
                    holding a meeting—women who appeared to be dressed up as men, and men of whom
                    one could scarcely believe that they were men. The manner in which they were
                    conversing disgusted him; their movements, their voices, the way in which they
                    were attired, produced a feeling of nausea.</p>
                <p>At length <persName key="hardenfeld">Dr. Hardenfeld</persName> appeared and
                    ushered him into his consulting-room. By means of a thousand penetrating
                    questions, this man explored the patient's emotional life for hours. <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had to submit to an inquisition of the
                    most ruthless kind. The shame of shamelessness is something that actually
                    exists, he thought, during these hours, and clung to this definition, which he
                    had once found in some philosophical work, in an effort to banish the feeling he
                    had of standing there as if in the pillory. His emotional life was undergoing an
                    ordeal which resembled running the gauntlet.</p>
                <p>And when this torture came at last to an end, the inquisitor
                    <!-- RJP:2018-03-12: Group decision to not tag this even though agree is an interesting alt name for Hardenfeld -->
                    dismissed him with the words: "I shall expect you to-morrow morning at the same
                    time."</p>

                <p>Then it was <persName key="karner">Dr. Karner</persName>'s turn. <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had by now acquired a sort of routine in
                    answering the questions put to him. This examination took the form of a
                    conversation throughout. Before <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was
                    aware of it, he found himself in the midst of a real "masculine conversation",
                    its theme being the political relations between <placeName key="france"
                        >France</placeName> and <placeName key="germany">Germany</placeName>. And
                    thus, quite incidentally, the doctor introduced a long, fine syringe into
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' arm, in order to take a blood
                    test.</p>
                <p><persName key="karner">Dr. Karner</persName> also dismissed him with the words:
                    "And I will see you again in the morning."</p>
                <p>Exhausted by his ordeal, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> at length
                    made his way to <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> and <persName
                        key="hvideIng">Inger Hvide</persName> in the evening.</p>
                <p>"No," he exclaimed, "don't ask me anything now. I am not fit to answer questions.

                <p><persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> had a previous engagement for the
                    evening; but <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> accepted his friend's
                    proposal with alacrity.</p>
                <p>They proceeded first to a Russian restaurant, where they enjoyed a supper of many
                    courses, washed down with several glasses of vodka. Then they sampled German,
                    French, Hungarian, and Spanish wines in bars and cafés of the most various kind.
                    To the surprise of them both, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> proved
                    a good tippling comrade this evening.</p>
                <p>"Your health, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>!" said <persName
                        key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>, who had again remarked his friend's
                    astonishing drinking capacity. "You are really a strange fellow. This evening
                    you are behaving just like a rake—and to-morrow you will perhaps be insisting
                    that henceforth I must treat you like a lady. When I look at you <pb n="60"/>

                <p>
                    <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> regarded him calmly. "I know what
                    you are trying to get at. It is difficult to make head or tail of this change,
                    difficult for me, but much more difficult for others. And the strangest thing of
                    all, believe me, is that each of the beings within me is healthy and perfectly

                <p><persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> raised his glass. "And now we will

                    between eighty and one hundred per cent of feminine characteristics. The

                <p>Late that evening <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was again sitting
                    with <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> and <persName key="hvideIng"
                        >Inger</persName>.</p>
                <p>After the three of them had finished dinner, during which husband and wife had
                    intentionally avoided putting questions to <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> as to the outcome of the various medical examinations,
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> lit a cigarette, rose to his
                    feet, and extinguished all superfluous lights, leaving only a solitary electric
                    candle, suspended in an alcove, to cast a feeble light.</p>
                <p>He sat down in a convenient armchair, and without any introduction began in a
                    free and easy style.</p>
                <p>"Yesterday evening, <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>, I pondered very
                    deeply over your words."</p>
                <p>"Over my words?"</p>
                <p>"Yes; as you said, the most important thing at the moment is for me to be
                    perfectly clear in my own mind—I am using your own words—how this strange,
                    fantastic change which I have been undergoing from my childhood onwards has been
                    taking place—"</p>
                <p>"And how <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> has gradually gained the upper hand
                    over you," said <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>, finishing the
                    sentence.</p>
                <p>"Well, then. I <hi rend="italics">did</hi> ponder over this last night;
                    especially as it is by no means unlikely that the present night will be the last
                    night of—"</p>
                <p>"Nonsense!" interrupted <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName>.</p>

                <p>"Let it pass, <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName>," interposed <persName
                        key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>. "I know what <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> means."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> laughed. "However that may be,
                        <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName>, it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> my
                    farewell night. And in order that you may perfectly understand this, and
                    supposing that you both have as much patience as I have, I propose relating in
                    detail how all this has happened. . . . I have made a few notes, so as not to
                    lose the thread of my story. Who knows what the morrow will bring—whether I
                    shall be still I, or whether I, obliterated to a certain extent as <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, the person who is now sitting in front of
                    you, will start losing all memory of myself, in order to make room for another
                    person."</p>
                <p><persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> rose to his feet, paced up and down a
                    few times, and then remained standing in front of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. He too had now become serious.</p>
                <p>"I thought it would be something like that. And as you know me to be a
                    level-headed person, who mostly takes things as he finds them—that is, without
                    letting his feelings run away with him— incidentally I have not yet forgotten
                    the shorthand of my student days—I should like to suggest, if I am not hurting
                    your feelings, that you let me take down in shorthand the <hi rend="italics"
                        >curriculum vitae</hi> which you are about to relate. . ." He broke into a
                    laugh in which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> joined and then
                        <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName>.</p>
                <p>"An excellent opportunity," exclaimed <persName key="sparreAn"
                    >Andreas</persName>, amused. "Your reporting will not affect me in any way
                    whatever. On the contrary!"</p>
                <p>"Then fire away!" With these words <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>
                    settled himself in an armchair, and produced a pencil and notebook. <persName
                        key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> reclined on the sofa and smoked her
                    cigarette.</p>

                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, "so let it commence with my
                    parents, whom you have both met. If I should grow tedious now and then, or too

                <p>"I will run my blue pencil through it afterwards, as your <persName key="tacitus"
                        >Tacitus</persName>." <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> completed
                    the sentence.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="father">Father</persName>'s ancestors came from <placeName

                        >Jutland</placeName>. From him I have my dark eyes. He was not a man of
                    bracing character, but rather effeminate, much concerned with himself and his
                    own comfort. <persName key="mother">Mother</persName>, on the other hand, was a
                    hale woman, with healthy nerves, a Nordic blonde type, perhaps even somewhat
                    hard in her temperament, an efficient housewife and a good mother. She died
                    before <persName key="father">Father</persName>, quite suddenly. <persName
                        key="father">Father</persName> was inconsolable. Their marriage had survived
                    many storms. After <persName key="mother">Mother</persName>'s death he revered
                    her like a saint.</p>
                <p>"She had four children, three sons and one daughter; I being the youngest.</p>
                <p>"I was a very happy child. Everybody pampered me, even <persName
                    key="brotherPlur">my brothers</persName> and <persName key="sister"
                        >sister</persName>. I was a great epicure, and could eat nothing but my
                    favourite dishes. From <persName key="father">my father</persName> I never heard
                    a harsh word in all my life. Whenever a slap was necessary, it was administered
                    by <persName key="mother">Mother</persName>. For the rest, she vied with
                        <persName key="father">Father</persName> in spoiling me, as all youngsters
                    are doubtless spoiled. <persName key="mother">Mother</persName> loved to dress
                    me up. I was never clad finely enough for her. Sometimes I was not allowed to
                    romp about with my playmates on account of my 'best clothes', and this was the
                    greatest distress I had to endure. <pb n="66"/>

                    <pb style="page" n="59"/> As a little chap I had long, fair locks, snow-white
                    skin, and dark eyes, so that strangers often took me for a girl. In a
                    kindergarten, where, as the only boy, I played with eleven girls, I was the
                    cleverest of all the children in knitting and embroidery. As a five-year-old, at
                    the annual prize-giving of our kindergarten I received my first mark of public
                    distinction for fancy-work.</p>
                <p>"As an eight-year-old <persName key="brotherPlur">my two brothers</persName>
                    often bantered me on account of my 'girl's voice'. I took this very much to
                    heart, and thereafter made great efforts to acquire a proper youthful bass.</p>
                <p>"Looking back on things now, it seems as if my childish voice was my first
                    dissimulation.</p>
                <p>"In other respects my childhood was nothing but sunshine. With <persName
                        key="brotherPlur">my brothers</persName> I played with tin soldiers, with
                        <persName key="sister">my sister</persName> with dolls. No one saw anything
                    strange in the fact that I was fond of pushing <persName key="sister">my
                        sister</persName>'s toy perambulator, as many brothers who have sisters do
                    this.</p>
                <p>"At nine years of age I went to the same <placeName>grammar school</placeName> as
                        <persName key="brotherPlur">my brothers</persName>. None of us was a model
                    pupil. My favourite subjects were French and Latin, but I was also one of the
                    most assiduous users of the school library, which gave me a high place in
                        <persName>our headmaster</persName>'s opinion. Nevertheless, I was usually
                    the last but one in the class. <persName>The old man</persName> himself taught
                    us French. He spoke the language correctly, with an excellent accent. Once

                    and afterwards he told us wrathfully that he did not think much of the

                    He was a droll chap.</p>
                <p>"Of a different stamp was <persName>my Latin teacher</persName>. He was a most
                    enlightened man, who not only taught us Latin grammar, but took great pains to
                    familiarize us with the intellectual atmosphere of antiquity and the art of the
                    ancients. He it was who first opened my eyes to the flawless beauty of Greek
                    sculpture. It was only a vague and remote comprehension. But I can remember as
                    if it were yesterday, when bathing with boys of my own age I would often blush
                    at seeing my own somewhat slim and delicate youthful body reflected in the water
                    beside the sturdy and not particularly well-proportioned youthful bodies of the
                    others. I was really built on much more delicate and flexible lines than were my
                    comrades. Then I would think of the youthful figures of <persName
                        key="praxiteles">Praxiteles</persName>, about which <persName>the Latin
                        master</persName> had been telling us a few days before. In the art-room we
                    had also a few plaster casts.</p>
                <p>"This reminds me of a little scene. At that time a number of girls were attending
                    our school. One of them attended the same classes as I. Once —during the
                    interval—she put her hat on my head for fun. 'Doesn't he look like a proper
                    girl?' she cried, and my comrades laughed with me. Suddenly <persName>our Latin
                        master</persName> stood in front of us. I was too frightened to take off the
                    girl's hat in time, and before I knew what was happening I had received a sound
                    thrashing. I was then in a perfect rage, and did not realize until many years
                    later why my old teacher had then felt it his duty to punish me. We poor humans
                    . . . what do we <pb n="68"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="61"/> know about ourselves . . . how much less about our
                    neighbours?</p>
                <p>"For the rest I was an ordinary boy. I was in the thick of all fights. Just
                    because I was more delicate than my companions I deliberately displayed special
                    daring. Many bruises were the result of this ambition.</p>
                <p>"Incidentally I went on long walks with <persName key="sister">my
                        sister</persName>. And when I knew that no one was likely to see me—as in
                    the wood close to the town—I pushed her doll's pram, which always accompanied
                    us.</p>
                <p>"In adolescence my interest in art constantly increased. When I was seventeen I
                    began to read art periodicals and to visit art exhibitions. <persName
                        key="father">My father</persName>, who, being an old merchant, thought
                    little of an artist's career for me, tried several times to divert my life into
                    a 'practical direction'. Thus he apprenticed me first to a merchant and then to
                    a master painter, without achieving anything except to intensify still more my
                    desire to follow an artistic career.</p>
                <p>"At the same time, like every adolescent, I had my 'flame'; indeed, to be honest,
                    I must even speak of 'flames'.</p>
                <p>"When <persName key="father">my father</persName> at length realized that it was
                    hopeless to try to interest me in anything 'practical', I was sent at nineteen
                    years of age to <placeName key="academyArt">an art academy at <placeName
                            key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName></placeName>. Here a number of
                    good comrades took me under their wing and took care that I very quickly lost my
                    provincial simplicity and embarrassment and that I also lost my innocence in a
                    thoroughly brutal fashion. Then I met <persName key="sparreGre"
                    >Grete</persName>.</p>

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had just come to <placeName
                        key="academyArt">the art academy</placeName>. She too was from the
                    provinces. We immediately became inseparable. We attended all the evening
                    lectures together. The ordinary teaching in <placeName key="academyArt">the
                        academy</placeName> was at that time so arranged as to divide the sexes.</p>
                <p>"<persName>A friend</persName> had brought us together.</p>
                <p>"When he learned one day that we were engaged, he became perfectly furious with
                    jealousy, not really on account of <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>,
                    but, and this I only learned many years later, on account of me. But even such a
                    symptom as this is really nothing extraordinary. How many friends have not had
                    similar experiences when a woman has come between them! A year after our first
                    meeting <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I were married. We were
                    still very young—I barely twenty, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> two
                    or three years younger. What did we know of life, of people? We were
                    indescribably happy in each other's society.</p>
                <p>"I recollect one evening in the first years of our marriage—we were then living
                    in <placeName>a studio which commanded a wide view over <placeName
                            key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName></placeName>—<persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was reading to me a primitive fable out of
                    antiquity. It ran somewhat like this: '<persName key="hermes">Hermes</persName>,
                    the darling of the gods, had a son, and <persName key="aphrodite"
                        >Aphrodite</persName>, the divine beauty, a daughter. The two children were
                    perfect models of beauty. Yet they had never seen each other before when one day
                    they confronted each other in the Wood of the Gods. The girl was immediately
                    enamoured of the boy; but the boy fled from her. However fast she ran after him,
                    he ran faster still. In despair the divine <pb n="70"/>

                    and bewailed to him her love torment. "I love him, father, but he has fled from
                    me. He will have nothing to do with me. Oh, father, grant that I become one with
                    him." And <persName key="zeus">Zeus</persName> heard the prayer of the divine
                    child, and he raised his arm, and the next moment the shy son of <persName
                        key="hermes">Hermes</persName> stood before the Olympian, and <persName
                        key="aphrodite">Aphrodite</persName>'s daughter shouted with glee, embraced
                    the trembling youngster—and again <persName key="zeus">Zeus</persName> raised
                    his arm—both melted into each other. When <persName key="hermes"

                    sought after their children, they found a blissfully smiling divine child. "It
                    is my son!" cried <persName key="hermes">Hermes</persName>. "No, it is my
                    daughter!" cried <persName key="aphrodite">Aphrodite</persName>. They were both
                    right.</p>
                <p>"'You know,' said <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to me, 'I love you

                <p>"About this time <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> painted the portrait
                    of the then popular actress in <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName>, <persName key="larsen">Anna Larsen</persName>. One
                    day <persName key="larsen">Anna</persName> was unable to attend the appointed
                    sitting. On the telephone she asked <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>,
                    who was somewhat vexed: 'Cannot <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> pose
                    as a model for the lower part of the picture? His legs and feet are as pretty as
                    mine.'</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> laughed. <persName key="larsen">Anna
                        Larsen</persName> was aware that once, when <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was painting a picture of a woman, I had been obliged to
                    come to her assistance with my legs. But it had really only been a question of
                    drapery. 'You really have very pretty woman's legs,' <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> had said to me jokingly.</p>
                <p>"While <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was talking to <persName
                        key="larsen">Anna Larsen</persName> on the telephone, I had been busy
                    cleaning my palette. I was smoking a cigarette and scarcely <pb n="71"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="64"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> listened when <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> informed me of <persName key="larsen">Anna
                        Larsen</persName>'s proposal. At first I declined rather shortly. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> chaffed me, abused me, implored me, petted
                    me, and a few minutes later I was standing in the studio in costume and
                    high-heeled shoes. We both laughed as though it were a great joke. And to make
                    the disguise complete, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> fetched out a
                    carnival wig from the depths of a trunk, a fair, very curly wig, and drew it
                    over my head. Then she attacked me with rouge and powder, while I submitted
                    patiently to everything.</p>
                <p>"When all was ready we could scarcely believe our eyes. I turned round and stared
                    at myself in a mirror again and again, trying to recognize myself. Was it really
                    possible, I asked myself, that I could be so good-looking? <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> clapped her hands delightedly. 'The most
                    perfect ladies' model,' she cried again and again. 'You look just as if you had
                    never worn anything but women's clothes in your life.'</p>
                <p>"And I cannot deny, strange though it may sound, that I enjoyed myself in this
                    disguise. I liked the feel of soft women's clothing; indeed, I seemed to take
                    them as a matter of course. I felt at home in them from the first moment.
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> began to paint.</p>
                <p>"Then a bell rang in the corridor, and a moment later <persName key="larsen">Anna
                        Larsen</persName> rustled into the studio. She had managed to find time.</p>
                <p>"She looked at me, but did not recognize the strange lady in front of her. She
                    only recognized her own clothes. Then she uttered a cry of delight and embraced
                    me violently.</p>

                    peeped at me from every angle. I had to turn about and assume every possible
                    position. Finally she asserted that I was very much prettier as a girl than as a
                    man. I wore ladies' clothes very much better than male costume. 'Yes,' she
                    maintained—and I have never forgotten these words, 'you know, <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, you were certainly a girl in a former
                    existence, or else Nature has made a mistake with you this time.'</p>
                <p>"She spoke quite slowly, quite deliberately, and it was obvious that she was

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> gave me a hint to take off the

                    herself.</p>
                <p>"I made a movement to retire; but <persName key="larsen">Anna Larsen</persName>
                    held me back. 'No,' she cried, 'I simply could not endure to meet <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> again to-day. We won't even speak of him.
                    Listen, and now I will christen you, my girlie. You shall receive a particularly
                    lovely, musical name. For example, <hi rend="italics"><persName key="lili"
                            >Lili</persName></hi>. What do you say to <hi rend="italics"><persName
                            key="lili">Lili</persName></hi>? Henceforth I will call you <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>. And we must celebrate this! What do you say,
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>?'</p>
                <p>"And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> merely nodded, looked now at
                        <persName key="larsen">Anna</persName>, now at the child about to be
                    christened; and then the three of us kept up rejoicings until far into the
                        night—<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s christening night.</p>
                <p>"So <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> came into existence, and the name stuck;
                    nor was it merely a question of the name.</p>
                <p>"With an extravagant joke, a genuine accident of the studio, if you like, it
                    started, and for many years we played our game with <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>"A few weeks after <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s christening an artists'
                    ball was held. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> suggested that
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> should go <pb n="75"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="66"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> in order to be introduced into the larger
                    world, and she designed a pierrette's costume.</p>
                <p>"It was a complete success. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was one of the
                    most popular dancers of the evening. <persName>An officer</persName> paid her
                    special attentions. Eventually he called her out for every dance, and towards
                    midnight he became somewhat obtrusive. Then <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    tried to disclose her secret. It availed her nothing—<persName>the
                        officer</persName> simply would not believe her! When she managed to escape,
                    she fell out of the frying-pan into the fire. <persName>A fresh
                        cavalier</persName> caught hold of her, and would not let her go. On the
                    spot he requested permission to kiss her, at least, on the neck. When at length
                    she escaped from his clutches, the pierrette costume bore some trace of the
                    struggle.</p>
                <p>"Another remarkable fact came to <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s notice
                    during this ball—the attitude of the female sex towards her. Several times she
                    had regarded with a friendly smile such ladies as she found attractive. But most
                    of them had returned her confident look with an icy stare. She was perplexed,
                    and at last inquired of <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> whether she
                    had behaved herself badly, whether she looked impossible. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> said with a smile, 'Our stupid <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> is very young. She does not yet know the malice
                    and mistrust of women towards other women.'</p>
                <p>"It was the first time that <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was conscious of
                    possessing a separate personality. And out of this amusing incident came
                    something like a presentiment. How often have my thoughts wandered back to that
                    far-off evening!</p>
                <p>"But this evening yielded another experience, which was no less
                    characteristic.</p>

                        >Lili</persName> were preparing to return home. In the search for her cloak
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> ran into the arms of <persName
                        key="hauwitz">a tall painter who belonged to <placeName key="academyArt">the
                            academy</placeName></persName>. He was one of my four studio comrades.
                    For heaven's sake, what could I do to prevent the secret from being discovered?
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> behaved as if she had not seen him. He
                    seized her, squeezed her, and pressed half a dozen kisses on her neck. This time
                        <hi rend="italics">I</hi> came to <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s
                    assistance. A few well-armed blows caught the insolent fellow right on the face
                    . . . . <persName key="hauwitz">Hauwitz</persName> was the man's name.</p>
                <p>"When I entered the class in <placeName key="academyArt">the academy</placeName>
                    the following day, I found the comrades in the thick of a discussion of the
                    carnival night. <persName key="hauwitz">Hauwitz</persName> was the most
                    enthusiastic of them all. He recounted his experiences in the grand manner.</p>
                <p>"'But where were you hiding yesterday?' he attacked me at once. The others, too,
                    asked me why I had not been present, especially as <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> had been there.</p>
                <p>"I explained that I had not felt well. Anyhow, I knew that the comrades enjoyed
                    themselves very much, especially <persName key="hauwitz">Hauwitz</persName>, who
                    had courted <persName key="lili">a pierrette</persName> very ardently.</p>
                <p>"How did I know that, threw in <persName key="hauwitz">Hauwitz</persName>,
                    flattered: a man could not move, it seemed, without giving rise to gossip; who,
                    then, has been so indiscreet as to betray his little adventure?</p>
                <p>"'I know you're a famous heart-breaker,' said I. 'Let's hear all about it.'</p>
                <p>"At first <persName key="hauwitz">Hauwitz</persName> refused chivalrously. 'I
                    hope I'm a gentleman. Moreover, <persName key="lili">the pierrette</persName>
                    was really a fabulous person.'</p>
                <p>"He simpered and winked at me expectantly. <pb n="77"/>

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> The others crowded round him. 'Fire away,
                        <persName key="hauwitz">Hauwitz</persName>,' they encouraged him.</p>
                <p>"'No; friend <persName key="sparreAn">Sparre</persName> seems to know all about
                    it. Ask him,' he replied meaningly.</p>
                <p>"'But, my dear <persName key="hauwitz">Hauwitz</persName>, please do not
                    misunderstand me. I should be the last to give anyone away,' I retorted,
                    inquiring at the same time: 'Was she really so pretty, then?'</p>
                <p>"'You can suppose as much as you like,' broke out <persName key="hauwitz"
                        >Hauwitz</persName>. 'You cannot go too far in your suppositions. An unheard
                    of thing!'</p>
                <p>"Whereupon he relapsed into silence, which was more eloquent than the coarsest
                    boasting.</p>
                <p>"To my intimate friends I afterwards confessed who <persName key="lili">the
                        pierrette</persName> was. <persName key="hauwitz">Hauwitz</persName> was
                    only initiated into the secret much later, after he had found further
                    opportunity to pose as <persName key="casanova">Casanova</persName>.</p>
                <p>"This ball was followed by others, at which <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    became accustomed to her rôle with growing success. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> titivated her each time, so that this strange creature who
                    had suddenly emerged in <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>
                    artistic circles began to cause a stir. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    gradually became indispensable to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.
                    For, strange as all this may now sound, it was not <hi rend="italics">I</hi> who
                    dressed up as <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, but both for me and for
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> very soon became a perfectly independent
                    person, in fact, a playmate for <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, <hi
                        rend="italics">her</hi> own playmate and her toy at the same time.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="lili">Lili</persName> and I became two beings. If <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> was not there, we spoke of her as of a third
                    person. And when <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was there—that is, when I
                    was not there—I was spoken of between her and <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> as of a third person. And soon our most intimate <pb

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="69"/> friends learned all this. But it was still a game for
                    many years.</p>
                <p>"In the depths of her soul <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> is utterly
                    melancholy. And to banish such feeling she summoned her playmate <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, was, in
                    fact, carelessness and serenity personified. Gradually <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> became equally important to her mistress in the capacity of
                    a model; indeed—I can say it calmly now—<persName key="lili">Lili</persName> has
                    been <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s favourite model. Whether it
                    was chance or not, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had more and more
                    success with pictures for which <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> posed as
                    model. And she began to see in <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> a kind of
                    mascot, a talisman that brought luck. A large number of <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s pictures and drawings originated at that
                    time in <placeName>our first studio in <placeName key="copenhagen"
                            >Copenhagen</placeName></placeName>, in which <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> appears as model in a hundred different poses. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s artistic fame spread. But nobody knew who
                    was concealed behind the model. Legends sprang up around it. Rumour also began
                    to whisper, without, however, discovering the track of the secret.</p>
                <p>"<persName>A well-known writer</persName> asserted that the model <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> was no creature of flesh and blood at all, but
                    merely a female type, upon which <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s
                    imagination had fastened, and therefore an empty caprice.</p>
                <p>"Only a few suspected the connection. But nobody knew anything definite about the
                    mystery of <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>—with the exception of <persName
                        key="larsen">Anna Larsen</persName>, who, however, had been sworn to
                    silence. She kept her word.</p>
                <p>"One day <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> received an invitation from
                        <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> to exhibit her '<persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> sketches'.</p>
                <p>"And so the three of us were transplanted to <placeName key="paris"
                        >Paris</placeName>: <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, I,

                <p>"Before our removal to <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> we had already
                    made several journeys abroad.</p>
                <p>Whenever we were able to spare sufficient money from the sale of our pictures—we
                    were extremely frugal in our mode of living—we had travelled South, to study, to
                    paint, and to become acquainted with the world. <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> had not been with us upon any of these trips. There were
                    too many new things to see for <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I
                    to find any time to devote to her. But as soon as we found ourselves again in
                        <placeName>our native
                    studio</placeName>,<!--RJP:2018-03-19:Are we tagging this?--> she reappeared—and
                    then we had to acknowledge every time that we had really missed her.</p>
                <p>"We spent almost a whole year in <placeName key="italy">Italy</placeName> without
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. It was the most carefree year which I
                    ever passed with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. The romance of the
                    South was an indescribably splendid revelation to us two children of the
                    North.</p>
                <p>"How could we find time to . . . play? <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    was at that time serenity itself. In <placeName key="italy">Italy</placeName>'s
                    wonderland she never felt oppressed. She needed no distraction. Hence <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> was not conjured up by her.</p>
                <p>"And yet <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was probably more than ever closely
                    bound up with us both. Only it was no longer a pastime. About that time I began
                    to undergo a change in myself, the nature of which I did <pb n="80"/>

                    my influence upon <hi rend="italics">others</hi> . . . in <placeName key="italy"
                        >Italy</placeName> just at that time. In <placeName key="florence"
                        >Florence</placeName> an unfortunate person approached me. He was <persName>a wealthy foreigner</persName>.<!-- RJP:2018-03-19: Tagged? --> One
                    day, after he had been dogging me for weeks, he spoke to me and suggested that I
                    should take up my quarters in his villa, where I could pursue my studies as a
                    painter to my heart's content. I declined politely, but very firmly. After that
                    I saw him frequently. I was always with a lady, either with <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> or in the company of <persName>a strikingly
                        beautiful Sicilian</persName>.<!-- RJP:2018-03-19: Tagged? --> A very little

                    to a duel with pistols.</p>
                <p>"In <placeName key="rome">Rome</placeName> I had a similar adventure. In that
                    city <persName>an American
                    millionaire</persName><!-- RJP:2018-03-19: Tagged? --> wanted me to accompany
                    him to <placeName key="egypt">Egypt</placeName>. He pestered not only me, but
                    also <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. He sailed alone to <placeName
                        key="alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"Never before had I been placed in such delicate situations. Why this happened
                    just then in <placeName key="italy">Italy</placeName> I only realized much
                    later. When <persName key="kreutz">Professor Kreutz</persName> recently saw in
                        <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> a number of photographs taken of me
                    during recent years, including some taken on my first Italian trip, he pointed
                    to these very pictures with the words: 'That was when <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> could be distinctly recognized in appearance for the first
                    time.'</p>

                    were assigned to us. One of them overlooked an old neglected garden, and had a
                    mysterious alcove, with red-diapered curtains. The factotum of <placeName

                        >Jean</persName> by name, lost no time in telling us that <persName

                    rooms. He had died in the alcove with the red-diapered curtains. As <persName

                    ill-shorn cheeks. He had reason to regret <persName key="wilde">Oscar
                        Wilde</persName>'s death. Many a twenty-franc piece had been given him by
                    the unfortunate poet, with which to buy a few sous' worth of cigarettes, and he
                    had never been asked for the change, he added, as a delicate hint to us.</p>
                <p>"For <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I these two quiet

                    were altogether delightful. We often sat in front of the broad window
                    overlooking <placeName>the garden</placeName> and read page after page of the
                    works of the poet, whom I had admired for many years. Gradually <persName

                    we had made during our first Italian journey. <persName key="nino"
                        >Nino</persName> we called him. Henceforth we were inseparable. Within a few
                    days we had more acquaintances among the cosmopolitan artists with whom
                        <placeName key="capri">Capri</placeName> was teeming than was always
                    agreeable. Three or four times a day we met at <placeName key="morgano">the
                        'Morgano'</placeName>,<!-- RJP:2018-03-19: Is it Morgana because D1 or do we need to adjust key? -->
                    and evening after evening we played chess and draughts. It went without saying
                    that we mustered our full strength during bathing-hours on <placeName>the tiny
                        beach at <placeName key="marinaPiccola">Piccola

                <!-- RJP:2018-03-19: Tagged? Beach and Marina; separate? together? -->
                <p>"Here we met one day <persName>a Scotsman</persName>, who always appeared in the
                    company of a very pretty boy. When bathing the boy was
                    transformed, to our astonishment, into <persName>a very nice
                    girl</persName>.</p>
                <p>"'Just what I expected,' declared a Venetian sculptor who belonged to our clique
                    when this revelation burst upon us. 'I knew it from the start! A girl cannot
                    impersonate a man, neither can a man impersonate a girl. Those who have eyes to
                    see can detect the deception immediately. Some superficial thing always gives
                    the game away.' The man's name was <persName key="favio">Favio</persName>.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> threw me a saucy look. I understood

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="75"/> what it meant. At the hour of promenade the next
                    afternoon <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> appeared in the company of
                    a tall, slender young lady whom no one had hitherto seen in <placeName key="capri">Capri</placeName>. They
                    strolled past <placeName key="morgano">the 'Morgano'</placeName>, where
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had to return many curious
                    greetings from friends and acquaintances. Suddenly <persName key="signoraFavio"
                        >Signora Favio</persName>, the sculptor's wife, spoke to the two ladies,
                    inquired after me, and expressed the hope that I was not ill, as no one had seen
                    me that day. Would <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I like to come
                    to a social evening at <placeName>her villa near <placeName key="monteTiberio"

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> regretted that <persName

                    would not be back until early the following morning.</p>
                <p>"Then she introduced her companion—'<persName key="lili">Mademoiselle Lili

                <p>"<persName key="signoraFavio">The signora</persName> had achieved her aim, and

                    was welcomed with extreme cordiality by the whole company. <persName>A well-known Norwegian lady novelist</persName> pledged <persName
                        key="lili">Mademoiselle Lili</persName> in a lively toast as 'the most
                    perfect incarnation of French charm and Parisian elegance'. She did not stir
                    from <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s side. She invited <persName

                        >Grete</persName> were both delighted, for the enchanting, perhaps I should
                    say the piquant, thing about this new friendship was that <persName>this passionate Norwegian</persName> had hitherto shown a striking
                    aversion to me.</p>

                <p>"In the following days <persName key="lili"><persName key="sparreGre"
                            >Grete</persName>'s French friend</persName> gave a few more
                    performances. In order to explain my continued absence, <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> told everybody who was curious on the point
                    that her friend <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> and I did not get on at all
                    well together. But <placeName key="capri">Capri</placeName> is a small place,
                    and <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was soon obliged to 'depart', in order
                    to leave the field clear for me. <persName key="favio">Favio</persName> and all
                    the others remained completely unsuspecting.</p>
                <p>"When we returned to <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>, it frequently
                    happened that after <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had employed her
                    as a model during the hours of daylight, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    remained in bed during the whole evening. And if one or other of our intimate
                    friends dropped in, she did not, as formerly, fly into another room, but stayed
                    where she was and where the others were, and behaved charmingly.</p>
                <p>"Gradually everybody came to like her. She was, as <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was always obliged to acknowledge, the good fairy of all
                    our little studio festivities.</p>
                <p>"But everybody made a great distinction between <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> and me. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s female
                    friends, who treated me with almost ceremonial propriety, embraced <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> and petted her. So did <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>'s and my male friends.</p>
                <p>"It was also strange that when <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> found herself
                    among <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s lady friends—who, like
                    herself, were artists almost without exception— she felt the most feminine of
                    them all. At first the friends laughed somewhat heartily at this fact, but
                    gradually observed that <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s feeling was
                    genuine.</p>
                <p>"And thus it came to pass that month after month <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> insisted with growing stubbornness on her rights, and gave
                    place to me with increasing reluctance.</p>

                <p>"He possessed <placeName>a summer-house in a small town on <placeName key="loire"

                    be occupied by us that same evening, looked from the outside like a tobacco shop
                    with a café attached. The interior was usually let for cinematograph exhibitions
                    and dances. As there was only one piece of scenery, which, moreover, was useless
                    for our purpose, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was immediately
                    appointed scene-painter. With lightning rapidity she sketched the stage scenery
                    for the revue, which had been composed by <persName key="tempeteJean">Jean
                        Tempête</persName> himself.</p>
                <p>"At six o'clock in the evening everything was ready, and at nine o'clock the

                <p>"At seven o'clock <persName key="tempeteJean">Tempête</persName> and I repaired
                    to <placeName>the station</placeName>, in order to fetch the only member of our
                    company who was still missing, <persName>a young lady artist</persName> who for
                    some reason or other had not been able to travel with the others. She had to
                    play a minor part, that of a typical Parisienne.</p>
                <p>"The train arrived, but <persName>our Parisienne</persName> was not on board. It
                    was the last train before the performance.</p>

                    without the player the piece would collapse.</p>
                <p>"'Then we must ask <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to step into the
                    breach,' I declared.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and I, who had only been invited to
                    join the travelling party at the eleventh hour, did not belong to the company of
                    players.</p>
                <p>"'An excellent idea!' exclaimed <persName key="tempeteJean">Tempête</persName>,
                    and the moment he entered <placeName>the so-called hotel</placeName> where we
                    had found accommodation, he pounced upon <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>. Completely exhausted by her scene-painting, she was lying
                    on a rickety sofa.</p>
                <p>"'Out of the question,' she declared. 'With the best will in the world, I cannot
                    do it.' Then she gave me a furtive look. 'But perhaps . . . <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> can?'</p>
                <p>"'Who is <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>?' asked <persName key="tempeteJean"
                        >Tempête</persName>. They all asked the same question.</p>
                <p>"'Don't worry about that. The main thing is that she comes. She can play the part
                    without any trouble,' <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> assured the
                    curious circle. She caught hold of <persName key="tempeteJean"
                        >Tempête</persName>, drew him aside, and gave him the necessary
                    explanations. He shook with laughter, promised to hold his tongue, and then it
                    was arranged that while <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was being dressed
                    he should initiate her into the part of the fast-dyed Parisienne in the
                    seclusion of an hotel sitting-room.</p>
                <p>"When evening came and the revue was launched in front of a crowded audience, not
                    a soul in <placeName>the hall</placeName> suspected that <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> was not a genuine Parisienne. Moreover, <persName>the poetically

                        >Balgencie</placeName></persName>, who was a member of the charity

                    <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> that he sent a box of violet soap to the
                    unknown beauty at <placeName>her hotel</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"On this evening <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> became acquainted with her
                    truest friend, <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude Lejeune</persName>, the
                    tenor of the revue. He was the comic character of the evening. His mere
                    appearance on the stage unloosed a storm of merriment. He was the only real
                    artiste in this company of amateurs; that is to say, he was the only member of
                    it who was not an amateur.</p>
                <p>"Earlier in the day I had already noticed this young artiste, who with his droll,
                    lightning wit might have bobbed up in any <placeName key="montmartre"
                        >Montmartre</placeName> bar. He had completely irregular features and
                    colourless, somewhat deep-set eyes, the whole capped by a funny, pointed nose.
                    At first glance he would probably appear ugly, but if one looked at him somewhat
                    longer one would become conscious of a remarkable geniality and kindliness which
                    his whole personality radiated.</p>
                <p>"If anything he had given me (<persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>) the
                    cold shoulder, but his conduct towards <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was
                    of quite another character.</p>
                <p>"It went without saying that, like the rest of his colleagues from <placeName
                        key="paris">Paris</placeName>, he was soon 'in the picture'. As for the
                    rest, discretion was observed.</p>
                <p>"And the citizens, who had arranged a charity ball after the performance was
                    over, of which we 'Parisians' were to form the centre of attraction, saw in
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, who at the desire of all the

                    had remained in her stage costume, the typical Parisienne. Wherever she showed
                    herself, she was treated with exquisite courtesy. She enjoyed herself immensely.
                    She was sought after more than <pb n="91"/>

                    she found she could skip a dance, <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude
                        Lejeune</persName> made his way towards her, bowed in his most amusing way,
                    then, in order to show the most serious face in the world, screwed his monocle
                    tighter into his eye, even blushed a little, and said almost solemnly:
                    'Mademoiselle, may I, as soon as you have somewhat recovered, solicit the honour
                    of being your dancing partner a number of times in succession?' <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> looked at him somewhat surprised, and then
                    nodded. And during this night they danced together many times. They were both
                    about the same height. During the dancing they scarcely spoke a word to each
                    other. They danced, completely surrendering themselves to the rhythm of the
                    dance.</p>
                <p>"When the last dance was over, <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude

                        >Lili</persName>, blushed again, and said: 'Mademoiselle, may I hope you

                        <persName key="cupid">Cupid</persName>'s festive gondola—the sail was a
                    large red heart—and the launching had taken place, it transpired that, owing to
                    its splendid, as well as very weighty, equipment, the craft was extremely
                    difficult to steer. At <placeName key="balgencie">Balgencie</placeName>
                    <placeName key="loire">the Loire</placeName> is very impetuous, and treacherous
                    winds render a sail rather dangerous. It was therefore necessary for <persName
                        key="cupid">Cupid</persName>, as well as his attendant, to be strong
                    swimmers. As no practised and daring swimmer could be discovered among the young
                    ladies of the town, <persName key="tempeteJean">Jean Tempête</persName> very
                    discreetly asked me if I could not assume <persName key="cupid"
                    >Cupid</persName>'s rôle, provided <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude
                        Lejeune</persName> was assigned to me as squire. I was known to be an
                    excellent swimmer. I promised on behalf of <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    and also of <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>, who had meanwhile
                    become a good friend of ours.</p>

                    dressed up as the boy <persName key="cupid">Cupid</persName>. . . . The carnival
                    took place in glorious midsummer weather. The whole population stood on the
                    shore and greeted <persName key="cupid">Cupid</persName> with frantic cheers as
                    he sailed in triumph upon the smooth glassy surface of <placeName key="loire"
                        >the Loire</placeName>. With his golden bow he shot a rain of arrows at the
                    thousands of heads peeping through the trellis-work on the shore. And everybody
                    believed that behind <persName key="cupid">Cupid</persName>'s mask was concealed
                    the typical Parisienne from the revue of the last charity performance.</p>
                <p>"Upon <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> had devolved the task,
                    after the carnival was over, of conducting <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    to <placeName>her hotel</placeName> through a crowd wild with enthusiasm, <pb

                    he looked at her long and then said, very quietly: 'However you dress up and
                    whatever you want to make me believe, you are a genuine girl.'</p>
                <p>"He stopped, startled at his own temerity. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    stared at him.</p>
                <p>"'What is the matter, <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>?' she
                    asked.</p>
                <p>"'Nothing,' he said quietly, 'nothing at all. Or it is something? But if I told
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> what I was just thinking and what I
                    have been thinking all day, her brother <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> would certainly be very angry with me.'</p>
                <p>"Then he went, and when we saw each other again the following morning he looked
                    at me shyly and kept out of my way. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> had
                    again disappeared.</p>
                <p>"Year after year we all met again at <placeName key="balgencie"
                        >Balgencie</placeName>, where I gradually became accustomed to <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>'s and my double experience. <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> took part in the festivities and excursions. I painted very
                    industriously, swam and drank many glasses of wine with the notabilities of the
                    town. I had many friends there. All the inhabitants of the town knew me and were
                    delighted to recognize their houses and gardens and themselves in pictures of
                    mine, which might subsequently hang in the autumn exhibitions of <placeName
                        key="paris">Paris</placeName>. But nobody in the town suspected the identity
                    of <persName key="lili">the slender Parisienne</persName> who now and then
                    strolled with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName
                        key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> through the alleys of the town and out
                    into the country. These trips were among <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s
                    most delightful recollections. In the early dawn, before any bedroom window was
                    opened, the three of them <pb n="97"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="84"/> would march out into the summer morning, and not until
                    late in the evening, when the town had long since retired to rest, did they
                    return, tired and happy. <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> was
                    then <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s and <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>'s most delightful cavalier; he was their brother and
                    protector, and the friendship between them became ever more intimate and
                    permanent, a friendship which stood every test.</p>
                <p>"It went without saying that this 'triple alliance' continued in <placeName
                        key="paris">Paris</placeName>. Every Sunday <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude</persName> made his appearance, when he was the guest of
                        <placeName>the studio</placeName> for the whole of the day. And in
                    accordance with an unwritten law, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> always
                    received him at the door in the corridor. If, however, she was, by a rare
                    chance, absent, and I had to open the door to him, we greeted each other in a
                    very comradely way; he gave me his hand, asked about this and that; but I could
                    always remark his disappointment. In <placeName>the studio</placeName> he would
                    then look at my pictures, although quite cursorily; politics and similar topics
                    were touched on in conversation and even the latest Parisian scandal. But it did
                    not last long, at the most a quarter of an hour, and then <persName
                        key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> would look at me somewhat uncertainly.
                    'I have not yet said good day to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.'
                    And then he would disappear into the little kitchen to join <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>"But if <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> opened the door to him on Sundays,
                    he would at once go with her into the kitchen.</p>
                <p>"In this connection I recall a little incident which happened just at that
                    time.</p>

                    enjoyment of this drink during a day or a night is calculated to curtail
                    considerably our sojourn here below. Perhaps it was this drink which prompted us
                    to try out a new dance which <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> had
                    recently seen somewhere. Moreover, it was the first time that he had danced with

                    dancing immediately. The gentlemen must excuse him; he knew us both very well,
                    but in his establishment, unfortunately, they did not allow two gentlemen to
                    dance together.</p>
                <p>"We duly explained to the strict gentleman that all we were

                    one occasion, and I know that in your case I am dealing with irreproachable

                    sometimes invited to a smart artists'
                    club.<!-- RJP:2018-03-21: Could be an orgName? Is this a place or group? --> The
                    club evening usually consisted of a meal followed by a ball. One evening,
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> being tired, <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> went there alone with <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude</persName>, at his urgent request. A lady who was an intimate friend
                    of ours and knew me as well as <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>—for the
                    rest, nobody in the club suspected our double existence—made a point this
                    evening of introducing <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> to a number of
                    gentlemen, including <persName key="cousin">her cousin</persName>, a nobleman who was no longer quite young.
                    Hitherto <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> had declined to make fresh
                    acquaintances on these club evenings, which were rare events for her. She was
                    happy enough dancing with <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>, and
                    did not need any other partners. Yet, before she could decline, her friend
                    fetched her cousin: 'My cousin, <persName

                    immediately challenged <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> to a fox-trot. This
                    dance was followed by several more. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> could
                    not refuse. <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> nodded to her
                    merrily. Thus it happened that <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> danced with
                    her new cavalier until far into the night. When at length, completely exhausted,
                    she said farewell to him 'for the present', with the most solemn face in the
                    world he begged '<persName key="lili">Madame la Baronne</persName>', who, as his
                    cousin had whispered, was staying with <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> for a few days, to allow him to pay his respects to her
                    the following day. What else could <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> do than
                    make the best of a bad job?</p>

                    portraits of <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> all over the place. He was
                    beside himself with enthusiasm. Might he wait until <persName key="lili">the

                    assured him that this would be a useless undertaking, as her visitor, who was
                    also her <persName key="lili">sister-in-law</persName>, had been invited to
                    dinner with friends.</p>
                <p>"'Oh,' <persName key="trempe">the Count</persName> then exclaimed, 'so your

                <p>"The following day—we were taking tea in <placeName>our studio</placeName> with a
                    few friends and were just discussing <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s
                    involuntary experience—the corridor bell rang again. <persName key="trempe">The

                <p>"'I am sincerely delighted,' he began at once in his ceremonious way, 'to pay you
                    a visit' (I could scarcely find time to usher him in). 'As I have already told
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Madame Sparre</persName>, the day before yesterday
                    I made the acquaintance of your sister, <persName key="lili"

                <p>"Of course it was now very difficult to keep up the pose, but we succeeded in
                    doing so, and I replied: 'My sister will certainly be sorry to have missed the

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and our visitors had great difficulty
                    in strangling an outburst of Homeric laughter. I had to throw them a warning
                    look. Without thinking, I continued: 'Unfortunately, we are seeing very little
                    of our sister these days, invited everywhere . . . very much sought after . . .
                    scarcely home before midnight.'</p>

                    Count</persName>, looking at me searchingly. My heart felt like an anvil
                    trembling under the strokes of a hammer. He went on, speaking slowly and
                    blinking through <pb n="102"/>

                <p>"I agreed emphatically, and gave <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> an
                    imploring look to keep a straight face. I had just finished a lengthy and prolix
                    assurance that my sister and I did not resemble each other in the least, when
                        <persName key="trempe">the Count</persName> addressed to me an inquiry as to
                    whether my sister was, as his cousin intimated to him, not engaged, was really
                    free.</p>
                <p>"Foolishly enough I did not contest this point.</p>
                <p>"Whereupon he made an exemplary bow and, without beating about the bush,
                    declared: 'Then, monsieur, I have the honour of offering <persName
                        key="lili">the Baroness</persName> my hand.'</p>
                <p>"I thanked him in the name of my sister and promised to inform her of his
                    flattering offer. He then withdrew, amidst the exchange of numerous
                    compliments.</p>
                <p>"A moment later <placeName>our studio</placeName> was rocking with the roaring
                    laughter of <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and our visitors.</p>
                <p>"I did not join in. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s experience at the ball
                    was taking her out of her depth. I had to think of a way out.</p>
                <p>"'Quite simple,' cried <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, whose laughter
                    had brought tears into her eyes. 'I will tell the cousin to inform <persName
                        key="trempe">the Count</persName> that his lady-love has been suddenly
                    obliged to leave for <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> for very

                    afternoon, which my

                    were also to spend with my relatives. My parents had not seen <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and me for a number of years. Consequently
                        <persName key="father">father</persName> and <persName key="mother"
                        >mother</persName> were disappointed to learn on their arrival that I was
                    not expected until later, as I had a very important call to make first. Suddenly
                    the bell rang in the hall. The girl announced that a French lady was in the
                    passage and wanted to speak to <persName key="sparreGre">Madame Grete
                        Sparre</persName>. The lady was brought in; <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> welcomed her in the most cordial manner. It was a friend
                    from <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>—unfortunately she only spoke
                    French. And . . . <persName key="father">Father</persName> immediately began a

                        >Paris</placeName>. It was the middle of winter. 'Don't forget,' she said to

                    'the lady comes from a much milder climate and is so thinly clad. Please tell

                    neither more nor less. We were as little perturbed at the obviously growing
                    distinction, of an emotional kind, which increasingly manifested itself between
                    the mystical girl and myself; nor did anyone take any serious notice of the
                    delicate changes which gradually became perceptible in my physical form.</p>

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> at first looked at me astonished.
                    Then she nodded and said in her calm, thoughtful way: 'It is strange that you
                    have mentioned something which has been on my mind a good deal lately. In recent
                    months I have felt prickings of conscience because I was, to a certain extent,
                    the cause of creating <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, of enticing her out

                    not at once. I spoke and she listened to me. 'What you say is all so terribly

                <p>"Perhaps this conversation had the effect of plunging me into a momentary fit of
                    despondency; but in other respects my health had been excellent during all these
                    years. In spite of the fact that I had never looked very robust, although I was
                    equal to every physical exertion, I had never really been ill. Just recently I
                    had frequently felt indisposed, my chief sensation being one of utter weariness.
                    Also, I had not stood too well the very cold rainy weather which <placeName
                        key="paris">Paris</placeName> had latterly experienced year after year. I
                    would cough from late autumn until spring almost without intermission. No doubt
                    that is how I came to have gloomy thoughts. One cannot be young for ever, I
                    would reflect. And then I would think of <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>.
                    She shared her body with me. She was a woman. To remain young meant more for her
                    than for me.</p>
                <p>"My outlook became more and more melancholy. By nature I had always been a gay
                    person, especially as long as I lived in <placeName key="paris"
                        >Paris</placeName>. But all this was now over. There were days, weeks, and
                    months when I felt utterly impotent. The power to work went out of me. Everybody
                    who had known me for years knew that I had been an industrious person. I could
                    not understand myself.</p>
                <p>"At intervals there would be a return of more lucid periods, whenever I could
                    live in the country far from <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> and
                    collect fresh subjects, especially in <placeName key="balgencie"

                    slavishly. Not a word of contradiction on my part did he encounter. And not only

                    differently, to bow somewhat more or less at some figure or the other, and the

                    nothing. Only our most intimate friends had been initiated, among whom
                        <persName>the doctor</persName> was not numbered. Hence I did not broach the
                    subject of my double life during this visit, although I myself had begun to
                    suspect a connection between this and my physical condition.</p>
                <p>"As, after making a thorough examination, he found nothing which would explain

Also, since this doctor does indicate a recognition of Lili's condition there could be a chance we could identify him (if he is real... that is).-->
                    then examined my body with great particularity and growing astonishment, and
                    eventually thought he was able to detect strange irregularities in my inside.
                    For the rest, he declared that the only thing to be <pb n="115"/>

                    constitution was very healthy and unimpaired; such a body as mine could stand a
                    good deal.</p>
                <p>"Although <persName>this doctor</persName> had not said anything definite, this
                    conversation gave me confidence and an almost mystical hope.</p>
                <p>"By this time I was perfectly clear in my own mind that something of a most
                    unusual character must be happening inside me. I had inferred this more from
                        <persName>the doctor</persName>'s expression than from anything he had
                    said.</p>
                <p>"And then, like so many sick persons who do not know what is really the matter
                    with them, I began to procure all kinds of scientific books dealing with sexual
                    problems. Within a short time I acquired an expert knowledge in this department,
                    and knew many things of which the layman hardly dreams. But gradually it became
                    clear to me that nothing which related to normal men and women could throw any
                    light on my mysterious case.</p>
                <p>"So it came about that I formed an independent opinion, to the effect that I was
                    both man and woman in <hi rend="italics">one</hi> body, and that the woman in
                    this body was in process of gaining the upper hand. Upon this assumption I
                    explained the disturbances, both physical and psychic, from which I was
                    suffering to an increasing extent.</p>
                <p>"All this I confided to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. And when,
                    encouraged by her, I submitted my theory to various doctors in <placeName

                        >Versailles</placeName>, they greeted it not merely with head-shakings, but
                    even with disdain. The most polite among them treated me indulgently for every
                    possible illness, while others regarded me as an hysterical subject, or simply
                    as a lunatic.</p>

                    young, just as they did then so many years ago. But I joined in the laughter,
                    although my laugh was forced and mechanical. My old zest in life had vanished. I

                    efforts. When I lay awake at night beside her, I observed that she too was lying
                    with wide-open eyes. Our evenings we passed with <persName key="feruzziRi"
                        >Feruzzi</persName>. His character, too, underwent a gradual change. A
                    fitful melancholy weighed upon him, even when he tried to appear cheerful. He
                    confessed that when all was said and done his life had been a failure. He could
                    understand men who had reached this conclusion turning to the cloister as their
                    last refuge. Undoubtedly there were such men, even in the twentieth century. I

                    she had missed for my sake. For me life had no longer any attraction. I know
                    this is a shallow thing to say, for others, but for me it said and comprised
                    everything. Why should I drag out a miserable existence any longer? No doctor
                    could discover what was the matter with me, nobody could help me. To go on
                    living, ill and old before my time . . . the idea was too horrible to
                    contemplate. I thought all this out without any feeling of self-commiseration.

                    I gave myself a year's reprieve. If in the course of this year I should not find

                <p>"As the Parisian summer was too warm, we withdrew to <placeName key="versailles"
                        >Versailles</placeName>, in <placeName>the neighbourhood of <placeName
                            key="versaillesPark">the Park</placeName></placeName>. Our life resumed
                    its normal course. Neither <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> nor I were
                    fond of making much fuss about our weal and woe, our joys and sorrows. Work is
                    the best doctor, I said to myself. And as often as my condition permitted, I
                    went into <placeName key="versaillesPark">the Park</placeName> with my paintbox
                    and easel, just as I did in former years. And <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> came as often as she liked, to distract <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and herself.</p>
                <p>"The only person who had a fairly clear <pb n="123"/>

                        key="lejeuneClaude">Claude Lejeune</persName>. At that period he was a
                    comforter to us both. Without the need of many words, he divined what was
                    concealed behind the apparent calm which <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> and I—and <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>—showed him
                    on all his visits. When he came on Sunday, the old gaiety reigned once more
                    among us.</p>
                <p>"If we had not had <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude Lejeune</persName> at

                <p>"He, like <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, had long realized that the
                    only thing that was still vital within me was <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>. This they believed firmly. And hence they both encouraged
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> to come as often as she liked.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude Lejeune</persName> often took long walks
                    with her through <placeName key="versaillesPark">the Park of <placeName
                            key="versailles">Versailles</placeName></placeName>, forging plans for
                    the future.</p>
                <p>"On one such evening, when the setting sun had turned to molten gold all the
                    windows of <placeName key="versaillesPalace">the
                    palace</placeName><!--we should add a key id here--> and the smooth surface of
                    the water in the pond, they were strolling arm in arm along the terrace.
                    Suddenly they heard a lady say to her companion in passing: 'Look! Two happy
                    people!'</p>
                <p>"Most of our friends and acquaintances understood my condition much better than
                    all the doctors whom we had consulted. Of course, their sympathy was limited to
                    words. Nevertheless, their words often gave me moral support. They saw in me an
                    overweighted man, whose sufferings were a real martyrdom, and not, as the French
                    doctors declared over and over again, imagination and hysteria.</p>
                <p>"One day I met <persName>an elderly French painter</persName> in <placeName

                    <pb style="page" n="107"/> inquired sympathetically after my health. I answered
                    evasively, without betraying the least hint of the real state of the case.</p>
                <p>"To my astonishment he made answer in my place.</p>
                <p>"I have been observing you for some time, without your having noticed it, here in
                        <placeName key="versaillesPark">the Park</placeName> , when you are
                    painting. I have been struck with the complete change that has come over you
                    during recent years. Formerly you gave one the fresh, sharp impression of a
                    healthy man. Now, if you will pardon my saying so, the effect you have on me is
                    for all the world like that of a girl impersonating a man. You are ill. You are
                    even very ill. You are undergoing a transformation. It is a fantastic idea; but
                    what had never been before may become actuality to-morrow. We have known of
                    cases of inversion for a long time, and doctors can deal with them. Why
                    shouldn't you also be helped. It is to be hoped you will find a courageous and
                    imaginative doctor. Everything depends on this. Of course, you will wonder how a
                    poor painter can find the enormous fee for such an undertaking. Let us hope,
                    nevertheless, that you will find a man prepared to assist you for humane and
                    scientific reasons.'</p>
                <p>"These and similar expressions of understanding were like little oases in my
                    progress through the desert, and they gave me courage and strength to prolong
                    yet a little further my hopeless quest of a saviour.</p>
                <p>"During this last summer at <placeName key="versailles">Versailles</placeName> I
                    began to notice that when I was standing in the street, or walking in <placeName
                        key="versaillesPark">the Park</placeName>, people often stared at me <pb
                        n="125"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="108"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> in astonishment, even in the shops which I had
                    been accustomed to visit for years. I had occasionally been aware of the same
                    thing in <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> during recent years, but never
                    to the same extent as was now the case in <placeName key="versailles"
                        >Versailles</placeName>. Moreover, Parisians are the most cultivated, the
                    most indifferent and the most
                    blasé<!-- RJP:2018-03-26: Check accent is supposed to be there? Answer: Yes, in original. DRR-->
                    people in the world, while the Versaillese are semi-provincial.</p>
                <p>"One morning when I wanted to reach <placeName key="versaillesPark">the
                        Park</placeName> quickly, in order to paint, I took a short cut through a
                    corridor of <placeName key="hotelReservoirs">the Hôtel des
                        Reservoirs</placeName>, where several young waiters were standing.</p>
                <p>"I scarcely noticed them, but I had only gone a few steps when I heard behind me
                    in pure Copenhagen slang the words: 'Look at that smart girl in trousers going
                    to paint!'</p>
                <p>"Incidentally I may observe that the hotels in <placeName key="versailles"
                        >Versailles</placeName> are full of Danish waiters—I do not know why.
                    Probably because German and Austrian waiters were mainly employed before the
                    War, and, no doubt, owing to their knowledge of languages.</p>
                <p>"Enough! I behaved as if I had heard nothing, but went on my way pondering on the
                    meaning of this compliment—and then it began to dawn on me why I had attracted
                    attention everywhere in recent times.</p>
                <p>"A few days later <persName>the wife of our <persName>house
                        porter</persName></persName>, with whom I was on the best of terms, called
                    me aside and said:
                    <!-- RJP:2018-03-26: I know we have said we don't tag instances of Monsieur and Madam. But look at the references in this following exchange.

                    that Monsieur is a monsieur.' With eyes starting out <pb n="126"/>

                    while I answered with a smile: 'Madame,

                    am very much inclined to agree with the shopkeepers.'</p>
                <p>"These and similar incidents showed me that the situation was beginning to be
                    paradoxical. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> could not show herself in the
                    street on her own account, because she and I shared the same body—although not a
                    soul took any notice of her whenever she walked abroad, apart from occasional
                    pursuers. I, on the other hand, was stared at everywhere. Although I was dressed
                    perfectly correctly as a man and took long masculine strides, people took me for
                    a girl masquerading as a man.</p>
                <p>"It was not to be endured.</p>
                <p>"In the autumn, when we returned to <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>, I
                    noticed that I was beginning to attract attention there also, although it mostly
                    found expression in a somewhat more discreet manner. In the
                    tube,<!-- RJP:2018-03-26: Part of me just wants us to have the tube grabbed, but without an ID. Answer: No, there are many "tubes" says Dr. Cuaghie, and we haven't tagged vague things like "the tram" etc. -->
                    or in the 'bus, or in the tram, I frequently caught looks and words from people
                    who were watching me. The few remarks that I occasionally overheard were enough
                    to convince me that the opinion of the shopkeepers in <placeName
                        key="versailles">Versailles</placeName> was shared by others. With my
                    thorough knowledge of the sophistication of Parisians in general it became
                    doubly clear to me that I was really on the way to becoming a sensation—and this
                    fact made me more and more nervous. My nerves, which had been weakened by the
                    sufferings of long years, simply revolted: they could no longer bear the sight
                    of me pursued everywhere by wondering and curious grimaces. This molestation by
                    my fellows utterly depressed me.</p>

                <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                <p>"Thus I went again to <persName>the heart specialist</persName> with whom I was
                    acquainted. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had called on him a few
                    days before and had tried to explain to him my and <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>'s double life—and he had promised her to take me to <persName>another specialist in <placeName key="versailles"
                        >Versailles</placeName></persName>—although, personally, he regarded the
                    whole thing as a fixed idea of mine, and exclusively as a 'diseased imagining
                    without any physical foundation'.</p>
                <p>"'Your husband is healthy. His body is normal. I am speaking from a thorough
                    knowledge, from a thorough examination of his body, madame.' Such was the wisdom
                    of his concluding remarks.</p>
                <p>"This visit to <persName>the new specialist in <placeName key="versailles"
                            >Versailles</placeName></persName> was to be my last experiment, I had
                    solemnly sworn to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and myself, before
                    we set out on the journey. On my arrival I immediately received the impression
                    that the two doctors had settled their plan of campaign in advance: they wanted
                    to try to drive out of me my hysterical crochets and whims. After an extremely
                    superficial examination I was told point blank that I was a perfectly normal man
                    without any defect whatever, and that all I had to do was to try to behave as a
                    man with energy and good humour, in order to be able to lead once more the life
                    of an ordinary man <hi rend="italics">masculini generis</hi>. During this
                    summary of their profound judgment they regarded me with scarcely veiled irony:
                    they looked upon me as an hysterical subject, plainly as a fraud, and one of
                    them, <persName>the 'new specialist'</persName>, even hinted that I was really
                    homosexual. This suggestion almost broke down my self-control. If <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had not saved the situation by a ringing
                    laugh, repudiating on my behalf <pb n="128"/>

                    <pb style="page" n="111"/> the supposition as utterly absurd, I should have
                    seized the fellow by the throat.</p>
                <!-- RJP:2018-03-26: Interesting short scene regarding gender/sexuality studies. -->
                <p>"After this hopeless consultation, which profoundly depressed us both, my last
                    reserves of strength were exhausted. And I swore to myself that henceforth no
                    power on earth would induce me to consult new doctors. I would not run the risk
                    of being degraded again for the amusement of the medicos.</p>
                <p>"I said to myself that as my case has never been known in the history of the
                    medical art, it simply did not exist, it simply could not exist. Thus my doom,
                    which was also <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s doom, was sealed. All that
                    now remained for me to do was to go on living with all the patience that I could
                    muster until the short term that I had set to my life had expired.</p>
                <p>"Outwardly, nothing changed in the routine of our daily life. I was even cheerful
                    when friends or acquaintances visited us, but particularly so in my behaviour
                    towards <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, as I was afraid that she
                    might see through me. That she was seriously perturbed I could divine from her
                    whole attitude. She kept her feelings well under control, and generally showed
                    me a smiling countenance, behind which she was able to hide her despondency. She
                    had become so restless. Frequently, when she believed that I was not observing
                    her, she would look at me furtively with an air of such strange inquiry that I
                    feared she suspected my plans.</p>
                <p>"During these weeks I had only one desire: to hear music. Concerts I could no
                    longer attend, as I dared not see people. Consequently, I bought large numbers
                    of gramophone records, classical and modern music, all mixed up anyhow, and
                    during <pb n="129"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="112"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> long evenings our gramophone played until far
                    into the night. I swallowed everything that was music—gay and tragic, the most
                    banal and the most solemn, the most melodious and the most discordant
                    music—provided only it were music. It was my comforter, whether it moved me to
                    tears or prompted me to join merrily in some chorus, or even invite <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to dance with me.</p>
                <p>"At that time I lived on music. If I could not sleep, I fled to music. If I was
                    unable to open my eyes in the morning, <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> would fetch the gramophone from <placeName>the
                        studio</placeName> to my bedside. It was not that I was abnormally receptive
                    or sensitive. I was never less sensitive that at this time. I merely felt
                    utterly lost, abandoned to a fate which transcended human understanding. Music,
                    the language of the soul, liberated me. Not to have to speak myself, not to have
                    to give shape to my hopeless brooding, not to think myself nor clothe my vague
                    ideas in words, was my daily and nightly prayer.</p>
                <p>"Formerly I had found distraction in reading. Now I never opened a book. What
                    were the fates of strange persons to me, unless I could find consolation in
                    reading about a person of my own kind? But of such a person no author had been
                    able to write, because it had never occurred to any author that such a person
                    could ever have existed. How could the philosophies of the Greeks and of the
                    present time assist me, which only tell us of the thoughts of men and of the

                    my sickly body dwelt <hi rend="italics">two</hi> beings, separate from each
                    other, unrelated to each other, hostile to each other, although they had
                    compassion on each other, as they knew that this body had room only for one of
                    them.</p>
                <p>"One of these two beings had to disappear, or else both had to perish. During
                    these nights I was obsessed by the delusion that this body did not belong to me
                    alone, that my share in this body grew less day by day, as it enclosed in its
                    interior a being which demanded its existence at the price of my existence. I
                    seemed to myself like a deceiver, like a usurper who reigned over a body which
                    had ceased to be his, like a person who owned merely the façade of his
                    house.</p>
                <p>"Now and then <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> would still appear, and
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was delighted every time she
                    came. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was gayer than I. Both of us knew
                    this. And <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> knew it was in her power to
                    comfort <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Sometimes, at <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s request, she remained for several days.
                    In <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s company <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was more easily able to bear the nights. <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> could fall asleep more easily. And when she
                    slept, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, too, was able to sleep.
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> often wept without <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> remarking it. <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> had always possessed her own dream world. She had always
                    had such delightful dreams. Now her dreams had vanished. They revisited her just
                    for a few nights. And every dream was a continuation of the previous one. It was
                    winter, and she would dream of a coming spring which was very sunny. She told
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> these dreams, but she felt that
                    they were only dreams. And then would come fear. The next night, however, a
                    still more beautiful <pb n="133"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="114"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> dream would drive her fear away. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> once told me that she had secretly recorded
                    many of these dreams in her diary. And she said this as if she were betraying a
                    secret.</p>
                <p>"'<persName key="lili">Lili</persName> has dreamed you a romance,' I said to her,
                    and turned empty away.</p>
                <p>"But this dream-romance became the favourite subject of conversation between
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> during those dark days, and these talks were the only thing
                    that gave <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> new courage and kept alive their hope that a miracle would
                    somehow happen.</p>
                <p>"Thus we reached February. <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> and
                        <persName key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName> were in <placeName key="paris"
                        >Paris</placeName> again. And one morning <persName key="rossiniEl"
                            >Elena</persName> took me with her to <persName key="kreutz">the strange man

                    third of March. In less than two months it will be the first of May. That is the
                    extreme limit of the period which I gave myself. Then <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas Sparre</persName> will exist no longer. Whether <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> will survive this day and live out her own life

                <p>When <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> entered <placeName>his
                        hotel</placeName>, it was almost morning. He stood at the window of his
                    bedroom and gazed down at <placeName>the square in front of <placeName>the
                            railway station</placeName></placeName>. A number of taxi-cabs were
                    there, a few belated pedestrians. A gleam of light was visible from the glass
                    wall of the long narrow booking-hall.</p>
                <p>He was very tired.</p>
                <p>Slowly he undressed. He stood nude in front of the mirror. He thought of an
                    expression he had used that evening: "I am like one who only owns the
                    façade<!-- RJP:2018-03-28:Check special character? DRR: Yes, like this in original.-->
                    of his house." The mirror in front of him showed him the
                    façade.<!-- RJP:2018-03-28:Check special character? DRR: Yes, like this in original-->
                    It was the unblemished body of a man.</p>
                <p>After a few hours he awoke in a cheerful humour, took a bath, breakfasted,
                    punctually paid, one after another, his last visits to the various doctors, and
                    felt almost carefree. In the middle of <placeName key="leipzigerstrasse">the
                        Leipziger Strasse</placeName> he heard a child's voice whisper: "Look,
                    mamma, a woman in man's clothes." He turned round, and encountered a frightened
                    look in two girlish eyes, probably a ten-year-old, with a thick, fair pigtail;
                    the child blushed a fiery red and clutched hold of her mother, who regarded him
                    with as much astonishment as her daughter, and then hurried along with the
                    child. </p>
                <p>A remarkable feeling of grim defiance welled <pb n="135"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="116"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> up in him. Without meaning to do so, or even
                    being aware of his action, he remained standing in front of a shop window,
                    gazing inquiringly at his own reflection in the smooth plate-glass window.
                    Irritably he muttered to himself. "There is nothing more to be done with me.
                    There is nothing more to be done with me." Several times he repeated this
                    sentence, and then looked at his watch. It was half past four in the afternoon,
                    and at five o'clock he had to be in <placeName key="gebhardSanatorium"><persName
                            key="gebhard">Professor Gebhard</persName>'s sanatorium</placeName>.</p>
                <p>He found himself in <placeName key="potsdamerPla">Potsdamer Platz</placeName> and
                    entered <placeName>the post-office</placeName>. In the huge telephone directory
                    he looked up the number of <persName key="schildtBar">Baroness
                        Schildt</persName>, whom he really ought to have visited before, and asked
                    to be connected. She was not at home. He despatched a few hasty lines by
                    post:</p>
                <!-- RJP:2018-03-28: Just verify everyone has the style attribute on the paragraphs part of the letter. Pamela and I will go back together and drop in the ID keys. DRR: Xixi made a comment in hers, as hers appears midparagraph. B1 is formatted like this though.-->

                <p>He threw the letter into the bag of the postman who was just emptying the blue
                    pillar-box. He pressed a shilling into the worthy fellow's hand. The postman
                    looked at him astonished. Before the man could thank him, <persName

                    and punctually at five o'clock entered <placeName key="gebhardSanatorium">the
                        sanatorium</placeName>.</p>
                <p>He was immediately led to <persName key="gebhard">the house-surgeon</persName>,
                    who regarded him with a benevolent mien.</p>
                <p>"I have just had a long telephonic conversation with my colleague <persName

                    operation which I have to perform. I should now like to have the opportunity of

                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> answered to the point: "Please,
                        <persName key="gebhard">Professor</persName>, ask me what you like." But
                        <persName key="gebhard">the Professor</persName> preferred a physical
                    examination to all questions, requested him to undress and lie down upon an
                    adjacent sofa of a type which had become very familiar to him since he had been
                    in <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"Yes," declared <persName key="gebhard">the Professor</persName>, after making a
                    detailed examination, "in yourself you are entirely what you represent yourself
                    to be in civic life, a man, but at the same time your body undoubtedly shows a
                    female conformation. I am surprised at the state of affairs." And while
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was dressing himself again,
                        <persName key="gebhard">the surgeon</persName> paced the room thoughtfully,
                    regarded the patient without pausing, glanced at his diary, and then said: "I
                    know you are in a hurry. Come early to-morrow morning." </p>
                <p>"That is not convenient, because I am to be photographed by <persName

                <p>"So we have a further reprieve," he said to himself, and looked at his watch. It
                    was nearly half past six. A taxi-cab was in <placeName>the

                    bedroom. He felt that his body and nerves could not stand any more strain that

                    enjoyment of the moment. Not to lose this precious moment was the impulse which
                    found release when he painted. He usually painted feverishly, and could scarcely
                    wait to catch the picture while it presented itself to his gaze, this gaze which
                    was purified by the winds of travel, which saw more than the vacant stare of
                    others, and which was brighter than that of others. Clairvoyant. How fond he had
                    always been of this word, and how it recurred to him at this moment!</p>
                <p>He had always been one with this intangible and restless something, this play of
                    light and shade, of claire-obscure, with colour and form. His attitude had been
                    like that of a sly bird-stalker who laid in ambush and knew all the calls that

                <p>Thus he had created his pictures, spellbound on the dead canvas with dead
                    colours, until what he had divined with his eyes suddenly began to take on a
                    life of its own. . . . Captured echoes, he had then usually confessed to
                    himself. My pictures are only feeble echoes . . . He had been happy and very
                    humble, like an initiate. And these hours had been the only real and genuine
                    joys of his life. These joys had belonged to him, to him alone, he could not
                    have shared them with, nor could he have stolen them from, any other person.
                    They had been exclusively <hi rend="italics">his</hi> wealth, <hi rend="italics"
                        >his</hi> property. Could he transmit this property, this wealth? This
                    question had never occurred to him before. Can one transmit joy? The joy of
                    painting? For him, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>, these
                    joys had gone beyond recall. And if <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> should
                    survive him, <pb n="139"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="120"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> would she feel any desire to paint? Would he be
                    able to bequeath her as a heritage this joy, this blissful feeling of creative
                    capacity, as a slight compensation for the life he had stolen from her, for the
                    many youthful years he had deprived her of? His consciousness of guilt which so
                    often weighed heavily upon him would be thereby lessened.</p>
                <p>He must now think of <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, who had such different
                    inclinations from his; but why now think of inheritance? What great thing had he
                    ever accomplished? True, he possessed a small token which he had to share with
                    nobody: the golden "palm" of <placeName key="ecoleBeauxarts">the Paris
                        Academy</placeName>. Oh, vanity!</p>
                <p>He wondered whether it was not time to return. He was standing upon <placeName>an
                        elegant lightly balanced bridge</placeName>, whence he could look over
                        <placeName>a wide canal</placeName> which poured its masses of water over a
                    sluice drawn half-way up, so that it hissed and glittered like a miniature
                    waterfall.</p>
                <p>"I am just like one who is trying to sail under a waterfall," he reflected, "and
                    I feel the current catching hold of me, and I no longer know whither the voyage
                    is leading. Perhaps into complete destruction. . . . Yet . . . now, half-way,
                    the boat cannot be left. The resolution is taken. I cannot go back."</p>

                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> pushed him to the door. A brief
                    handshake, and <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was alone.</p>
                <p>He paced up and down. Once, twice, thrice. Without knowing it he began to count
                    his steps. So the room was seven paces long and six paces wide. Then he sat on
                    the bed. He regarded the room. A room in a nursing-home like countless others.
                    Bright walls, and bed and table and cupboard and the two chairs likewise painted
                    a light colour.</p>
                <p>And then he began to undress very slowly. Suddenly it occurred to him that he,
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName>, was probably undressing
                    for the last time . . . that what was now taking place was a farewell to coat
                    and waistcoat and trousers and so on and so on. For a lifetime these coverings
                    of coat and waistcoat and trousers had enclosed him. He contemplated the
                    articles of clothing, one after another, as he took them off; he hung the coat
                    over the waistcoat, and then both upon the hanger in the cupboard, as he had
                    been accustomed to do since . . . yes, since when? He stretched the trousers in
                    the trouser-press, and looked at one article after another, and stroked each in
                    turn. "What will become of you? What will become of me? Which of us here will
                    survive the other? I—myself? I—you? . . . Coat, waistcoat, trousers, shoes,
                    underclothes, socks. . . ."</p>
                <p>And he picked up his hat off the table. "You too. I had almost forgotten you. Who
                    else have I forgotten?" And he slipped his hand in the inside <pb n="144"/>

                    <pb style="page" n="125"/> pocket of his coat, took out a picture, and stood it
                    on the table against the wall. "<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>," he
                    said, and started to stroke the picture. A knock was heard and the door was
                    opened. <persName key="gebhard">Professor Gebhard</persName> entered,
                    accompanied by <persName>his assistant doctor</persName>. A few questions were
                    addressed to <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, with the result that,
                    to his surprise, the performance of the "first operation", which involved no
                    danger whatever, as <persName key="gebhard">the Professor</persName> explained,
                    had to be postponed to the following morning. "'<hi rend="italics">Gravol</hi>'
                    is what you call such farewell celebrations in the North," laughed <persName
                        key="gebhard">the Professor</persName>. "Your friend has already betrayed to
                    me the Rhenish wine. Congratulations! You seem to know your way about there. But
                    operations of this kind are best performed on an empty stomach. In a few hours'
                    time we will give you a sleeping-draught, so that the time between now and
                    to-morrow morning will not seem too long to you. And now, courage." A
                    handshake—and <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was again alone.</p>
                <p>"So it's always wait, wait, wait, wait," he said to himself. "However, much
                    patience must one have," he said, addressing the portrait which stood on the
                    table next to his bed.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>." . . . More he could not say; he
                    leaned back on the white pillows, stared at the ceiling, and felt tired.</p>
                <p>He had struggled to the goal. He became sensible of the bustle of the day here in
                        <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>. Now he had to confess that he
                    was at the end of his forces. And the last remnant of his masculine pride, which
                    he had been dragging about with him in this strange million-headed city like a
                    cuirass, fell away from him.</p>

                <p>"With pleasure," he declared, and he immediately signed the document which was
                    addressed to some high authority, and which said in effect: "In case I die, I
                    renounce all right to make any difficulties hereafter." "But may I not add a few
                    words of thanks to the German doctors," he asked suddenly, "who are going to
                    make an attempt to save me?"</p>
                <p>This request was laughingly declined, and then <!--confirmed as Arns--><persName

                <p>Now everything was in order.</p>
                <p>A moment later <persName>the assistant doctor</persName> entered the room.</p>
                <p>When <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> woke up again, in violent pain,
                    it was almost noon. He opened his eyes with a shriek. Gradually he realized that
                    he was lying in his bed. It seemed to him as if he had been crying out for a
                    long time, as if he were resisting something. Two nurses were standing beside
                    him and speaking soothing words. When he recovered consciousness he felt the
                    pains growing more violent. With an effort he regained control of himself and
                    clenched his teeth. He would leave off screaming. And, in fact, he screamed no
                    more.</p>
                <p>"Did I make much noise?" he inquired.</p>
                <p>"Well, just a little," said one of the nurses with a smile, "and the strange
                    thing was that your voice had completely changed. It was a shrill woman's
                    voice."</p>
                <p>Then <persName key="gebhard">Professor Gebhard</persName> came in and took
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> by the hand. "It went off
                    splendidly. Moreover, I must congratulate you. You have a splendid soprano
                    voice! Simply astounding."</p>
                <p>Towards the evening he was awakened by a fit of coughing. It seemed as if his
                    whole body were being torn asunder. The coughing was terrible. He had tried to
                    suppress it, but without success.</p>
                <p>At last the fit was over, and he lay exhausted.

                <p>On the table by the bed lay a cigarette-case. </p>
                <p>"Throw them out of the window, <persName>Nurse</persName>. I will never put a
                    cigarette or cigar in my lips again." <persName>The nurse</persName> smilingly
                    removed the cigarette-case. "Don't forget your vow!"</p>
                <p>"I swear it to you and to me." And he thought of the cigar which <persName
                        key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> had taken from him yesterday. It was the
                    very last cigar which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had
                    smoked.</p>
                <p>Fresh fits of coughing in the course of the evening deepened his sudden hatred of
                    tobacco to such an extent that the very idea of tobacco filled him with nausea.
                    And this fanatical aversion from the enjoyment of tobacco in every form he
                    inherited from <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. </p>
                <!--DRR: this is a mistranslation from German. Danish says that Lili inherited this from Andreas.-->
                <p><persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> was admitted to him for a few
                    moments.</p>
                <p>"You're going on fine, what?" he began immediately.</p>
                <p>"Oh, yes." More than that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> could not
                    bring himself to say. <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> looked at
                        <persName>the nurse</persName> in astonishment.</p>
                <p>She whispered to him: "I suppose you are surprised at the clear voice."</p>
                <p><persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> nodded. "I cannot recognize it."</p>
                <p>Then he sat on the one chair next to the bed. "<persName key="hvideIng"
                        >Inger</persName> sends you her greetings. Otherwise . . ." </p>
                <p><persName>The nurse</persName> gave a hint. <persName key="hvideNiels"
                        >Niels</persName> stole out of the sick-room. And <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> whimpered: "<persName>Nurse</persName>, give me an injection. . . ." It was
                    not the only one he had during the night. It was an endless agonizing night. Not
                    until dawn did he manage to go off into a short heavy sleep. By the time he was
                    fully awake, about noon, he felt as weak as one who had been wandering through a
                    desert. But the pains seemed to have become more remote.</p>

                <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                <p>Only now and then the question would surge up in his mind, "Who am I? What am I?
                    What was I? What shall I become?"</p>
                <p>Soon afterwards <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> came—with flowers and a
                    large bottle of eau-de-Cologne. Flowers! How their scent transformed the
                    sick-room!</p>
                <p>"Drench me with eau-de-Cologne, <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName>!
                    Sprinkle it all over the room!" he cried, almost beside himself with joy.</p>
                <p>Then she sat on the bed next to him and began to talk in confident tones. She,
                    who had previously always addressed him as "you" now used the more intimate
                    "thou". He did not realize until many days later that during these first days
                    she never once called him by any name.</p>
                <p>Each day she came to see him with flowers and comforting words. So one day, two
                    days, three days passed. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> slept most
                    of the time. No dreams came to him in the long nights, through which he was
                    assisted by sedatives. And every morning <persName key="hvideIng"
                        >Inger</persName> was with him with fresh flowers.</p>
                <p>One day she brought with her a perfectly magnificent spring bouquet.</p>
                <p>"This time you must not thank me. The floral greetings are from a good
                    friend."</p>
                <p>"From <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude Lejeune</persName>?"</p>
                <p><persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> nodded.</p>
                <p>She opened the note attached to the bouquet and read:</p>

                <p>"Will <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName> ever find her again?"</p>

                <p>"<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>."</p>
                <p>Saying which, the invalid handed <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> a
                    card, on which he had scribbled a few lines.</p>
                <p>"Did you write this?" she asked.</p>
                <p>"Yes, <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName>."</p>
                <p>"But then she is there already; <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>'s

                <p>He gazed at the card and failed to recognize his writing. It was a woman's
                    script.</p>
                <p><persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> hurried out and met <persName>the
                        assistant doctor</persName>, who was standing in the corridor. She showed
                    him the card: "What do you think of this, <persName>Doctor</persName>. No man
                    could have written it?"</p>
                <p>"No," said <persName>the astonished doctor</persName>; "no, you are quite right.
                    One thing after another is pushing out." </p>
                <p>"One thing after another."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> distinctly heard the words.</p>
                <p>And <persName>the doctor</persName> answered: "Haven't you noticed the voice is
                    completely altered? It has changed from a tenor into a clear soprano."</p>
                <p>When <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was again alone, he spoke softly
                    to himself. He wanted to listen to his own voice. But drowsiness overcame him
                    and he fell asleep once more.</p>
                <p>He woke up suddenly in the middle of the night. A terrible shriek startled him.
                    At first he thought that he had himself screamed. He clenched his teeth. But the
                    screams were heard again. No, he had not screamed. It was like the shriek of a
                    tortured animal. He could not stand it any longer.<!--this paragraph doesn't end, even though it seems like it should-->

                <p>The next morning <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> arrived early.</p>
                <p>"Who do you think is coming in a day or two?" she cried, as she entered the

                <p>"Why the haste? You are doing very well here in bed amid flowers and soft

                <p>"But there is a hurry, <persName key="gebhard">Doctor</persName>. In three days

                <p>"Your wife?" <persName key="gebhard">The Professor</persName> was taken aback.
                    "All right, then, but have a little patience. Madame will certainly find you

                <p>Then he hurriedly left the room with his companion.</p>
                <p>"Did I do anything absurd, <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName>? <persName

                        >Lili</persName> knowing what we were about. We must make some preparations
                    for the journey to <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName>. In the
                    afternoon we returned to <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, bringing with us
                    a big cardboard box. 'Guess what we have brought you,' I said gaily. <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> regarded us calmly, without a smile. 'I don't
                    know.' That was her only answer. Then <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName>
                    opened the box. '<persName key="lili">Lili</persName> . . .' said <persName
                        key="hvideIng">Inger</persName>, spreading out the coat in front of
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, and showing her the silk lining.
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> looked at the coat, and said: 'But
                        <persName key="kreutz">Professor Kreutz</persName> will send me away if I
                    appear before him in this attire. He won't recognize me at all.' And her eyes
                    looked so sad. Really, they are always sad, even when she smiles. <persName

                <p>Mix with people. . . . At these words <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    listened attentively. A secret fear assailed her. She did not, however, betray
                    her feelings. <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> and <persName
                        key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> came to fetch her away with <persName

                    with fear. She looked as apprehensive as a prisoner breathing fresh air for the
                    first time after a long spell of captivity. She glanced about her timidly, as if
                    she feared that everything around her was a deception.</p>
                <p>She hesitated to proceed.</p>
                <p>"Come now, child," said <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> softly to
                    her.</p>
                <p>"She is proud," laughed <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>, "and, of
                    course, wants to go alone."</p>
                <p>"No, no," protested <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> in a frightened voice,
                    "don't let me stand alone. Just a moment more. I must just taste this air once
                    more. This air . . ."</p>
                <p>When <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was sitting in the car, huddled close
                    to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, she closed her eyes. "Don't
                    bother about me. I must first get accustomed to all this."</p>
                <p>And thus she drove through the roaring life of <placeName key="kurfurstendamm"
                        >the Kurfurstendamm</placeName>, like a somnambulist, silent and
                    self-absorbed.</p>
                <p>The drive lasted two hours, and then <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    put the tired invalid to bed again. She was scarcely able to peck at the food
                    that was brought her <pb n="164"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>

                    until the following morning.</p>
                <p>About noon <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> called for them both.
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was in much better spirits. "I shall
                    not bore you to-day, nor myself. I am really anxious to see people."</p>
                <p>"Aren't we such?" inquired <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>,
                    amused.</p>
                <p>"But I mean strange people—yes, I want to see strange people again."</p>
                <p>"A brilliant suggestion," declared <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>,
                    who resolved that they should dine with him, in order to celebrate the occasion.
                    He stopped the car mysteriously outside a telephone-box and descended. He wanted
                    to inform <persName key="hvideIng">Inger</persName> of his intention. And
                    wearing a still more mysterious expression he returned.</p>
                <p>In a quarter of an hour they reached their destination. <persName key="hvideIng"
                        >Inger</persName> was waiting for the party on the doorstep. She pressed a
                    big bunch of roses into <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s arms. "Be brave,
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. Now you will find what you are longing
                    for." And then they divulged to her that in <placeName>the flat</placeName> was
                        <persName key="wardalKar">a young lady from <placeName key="copenhagen"

                <p>She did not betray herself by even a look. True, she was obliged to bite her

                <p>"And she did not recognize me," she said sadly.</p>

                <p>It did not yet dawn on <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> that <persName

                    before going it was desirable to pay a visit to <persName key="karner">Doctor
                        Karner</persName>, who had tested <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' blood barely a
                    fortnight<!-- RJP:2018-04-04: date markup --> previously, to enable him to take

                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> read the communication to <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> very slowly, her voice trembling with
                    excitement.</p>
                <p>"We will leave to-morrow morning, of course," said <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Good; but in that case we must call on <persName key="karner">Doctor
                        Karner</persName> to-day." Saying which, <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> hurried out of the room in order to telephone to
                        <placeName key="laboratoriumKar"><persName key="karner">Dr.
                            Karner</persName>'s laboratory</placeName>.</p>
                <p>When she returned a few minutes later with the news that <persName key="karner"
                        >Dr. Karner</persName> would not be available for another hour, she found
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> standing in front of the window holding
                        <persName key="kreutz">Professor Kreutz</persName>' letter in her hand.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, we can start at once. We could walk part
                    of the distance. This will do you good."</p>
                <p>"No, no, not walk. I cannot yet show myself in the street." And her eyes filled
                    with tears.</p>
                <p>On the way <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> mentioned quite
                    incidentally that <persName><persName key="karner">the Doctor</persName>'s
                        assistant</persName>, to whom she had <pb n="169"/>

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> telephoned, had not understood her name. "It
                    was, indeed, somewhat difficult to make it clear to her."</p>
                <p>It so happened that their taxi and <persName key="karner">Dr. Karner</persName>'s
                    car arrived at <placeName key="laboratoriumKar">the laboratory</placeName> at
                    the same time.</p>
                <p>"Good day, <persName key="karner">Doctor</persName>," said <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>, immediately recognizing him and extending her hand.</p>
                <p>"Good day, madam," answered <persName key="karner">the Doctor</persName>,
                    momentarily surprised, as if he were trying to remember her name.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> looked in front of her, then looked at
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, and at last took courage to say:
                    "I have come from <placeName key="gebhardSanatorium"><choice>
                            <orig><persName key="arns">Professor Arn</persName>'s</orig>

                    It was the first time that she had pronounced her name. She heard herself
                    speaking. A feeling of shame overwhelmed her. "Don't you recognize me, then,
                        <persName key="karner">Doctor</persName>?"</p>
                <p>"But of course, madam, of course," answered <persName key="karner">Dr.
                        Karner</persName>, although it was obvious from his tone that he had not the
                    least suspicion of the identity of the person standing before him.</p>
                <p>"I understand it is a question of taking a blood test," he continued nervously,
                    and conducted the two ladies through the entrance hall and then into a
                    waiting-room.</p>
                <p>"Yes, <persName key="karner">Doctor</persName>; but are you still unable to
                    recognize me?"</p>
                <p><persName key="karner">The Doctor</persName> only became more confused.
                        "Sparre . . . Sparre. . . of
                    course the name sounds familiar. <persName key="sparreAn">Mr. Sparre</persName>
                    was here about a fortnight ago. He too was sent to me by <persName key="arns"
                        >Professor Arns</persName>. But I cannot call you to mind, madam."</p>
                <p>"The gentleman and I, <persName key="karner">Doctor</persName>, are, in fact, one
                    and the same person," stammered <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>.</p>
                <pb n="170"/>
                <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                <pb style="page" n="147"/>
                <p>"I beg your pardon." Completely dumbfounded, <persName key="karner">Dr.
                        Karner</persName> looked from one lady to the other—then looked at his
                    watch, and made a quick bow. "Oh, excuse me a moment—the ladies are foreigners,
                    of course." And he bounded out of the waiting-room.</p>
                <p>Beside herself with confusion, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> looked at
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. "I think I shall lose my
                    reason."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> laughed. "<persName key="karner">Your
                        doctor</persName> is certainly of your opinion. He did not understand a
                    single word of what you told him."</p>
                <p>Suddenly <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> began to laugh. "But that is
                    splendid. He too, then, did not recognize me."</p>
                <p><persName>A nurse</persName> came into the room and requested <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> to
                    follow her. <persName key="karner">The Doctor</persName> was waiting for her in
                    the laboratory, which <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> immediately
                    recognized. He was holding a small instrument, similar to a morphia syringe, a
                    transparent glass syringe. He smiled, still somewhat embarrassed. "Please,
                    madam."</p>
                <p>She heard the title ringing in her ears . . . madam.</p>
                <p>"Please, madam, will you sit down, and turn up your sleeve above the elbow, so
                    that I can get at the veins. So. . . . Much obliged, madam." </p>
                <p>With a distinctness never before experienced, <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> caught every word he uttered. It seemed to her as if the
                    words were floating in the room. Her eyes gazed steadfastly at the syringe,
                    whose needle was boring cautiously into her arm; she saw the glass container
                    slowly filling with her blood, and she fainted.</p>
                <p>When she came to herself, she looked around timidly.</p>

                <p><persName key="karner">The doctor</persName> was standing by the patient's chair

                <!-- RP:2018-04-07: consider how would we tag this? with which key? -->
                <p>"Have I been lying here long, <persName key="karner">Doctor</persName>?"</p>
                <p>"Only a few minutes. Did it hurt as much as all that?"</p>
                <p>"Hurt? Oh, no. You must not think that I am usually so bothersome."</p>
                <p>"Of course. <persName key="sparreAn">Mr. Sparre</persName> was not either.
                        <persName>Sparre</persName>; if I understood aright, madam, your husband . .
                    ." </p>
                <p>"Mine? Yes, yes." She was so confused that she did not know where to look.</p>
                <p>Then <persName key="karner">the Doctor</persName> laughed. "So I did understand
                    you correctly before. The German language is a very difficult language. What you
                    said before sounded very amusing—as if you had said that you and your husband
                    were one and the same person. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
                <p>"But, <persName key="karner">Doctor</persName>—"</p>
                <p>"Believe me, madam, even a German utters the most incredible stupidities when he
                    tries to make himself understood in a foreign language. However, to go back to
                    your husband—a stoic of a man, if you like. Now I remember, of course—although
                    he looked ill and exhausted when he sat before me in the same chair that you are
                    now occupying—he said not a word about his sufferings, declined even to hint at
                    them. Instead of this we conversed in the way usual among men here, especially
                    when one comes from abroad, that is to say, about politics, while I was tapping
                    his blood. Of course, I know very well that this cannot be done without hurting,
                    although your husband behaved as if—and really with success—while you, madam . .

                <p>"Please, <persName key="karner">Doctor</persName>."</p>
                <p>"But, madam, that is your vested privilege, as a representative of the weaker
                    sex, while your husband is, if I may so express myself as a doctor, a prototype
                    of the <hi rend="italics">masculini generis</hi>. . . . "</p>
                <p>"My dear <persName key="karner">Doctor</persName>"—<persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> now broke into a ringing laugh; she had risen and was
                    staring at him almost insolently—"if you only knew what a lesson you had read me
                    with those words!"</p>
                <p>"Lesson?" <persName key="karner">The Doctor</persName> chivalrously leaned over
                    her. "But I have nothing but admiration for you, madam. You allowed the same
                    blood test to be taken unbidden, in the same way as your husband—which,
                    moreover, was very sensible. Only women can really do such things. A pain shared
                    is a pain halved. Have I not come well out of the business?"</p>
                <p>"Splendidly, <persName key="karner">Doctor</persName>. And now, good-bye." </p>
                <p>"Good-bye; and my kindest regards to your husband."</p>
                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, dearest," said <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>, when they were again in the open air together, "I have now
                    got to the point of accepting with calm amusement the comic side of such a
                    situation as I have just been in, without the flicker of an eyelash. If I did
                    not do so, I should either go mad or lose myself."</p>
                <p>In the evening <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> wrote in her diary:</p>
                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c11d01p01">"<persName key="lili">Lili</persName> is

                <p>"Come," said <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, "now I will take my first walk

                <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                <p>So they both went from <placeName key="laboratoriumKar"><persName key="karner"
                            >Dr. Karner</persName>'s laboratory</placeName> through the bustle of
                        <placeName key="berlin">the great city</placeName>, jostling strange people.
                    It was a fine spring day. The sky was cloudless and softly blue. The air felt
                    like a prolonged caress. The faces of the people they met, <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> noted with gay excitement, had such shining eyes. "Do I
                    look like that, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>?" she asked many
                    times. And as they strolled arm in arm they often stopped in front of shop
                    windows. She never grew weary of gazing at their display of silks, and she saw
                    her reflection in every plate-glass window. "<persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, tell me, do I look all right in my furs? Do I look any
                    different from you?" And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> smiled on
                    her. "Child, remember your <persName key="karner">Dr. Karner</persName>—and be
                    glad that we have progressed so far as this."</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> desisted from her questions, but every now
                    and then her eyes would dart a glance of inquiry. Questions innumerable were
                    stirring in her breast; but she refrained from uttering them. She forced herself
                    to show a smiling face, and whispered to herself again and again: "Nobody knows
                    me and my fate here in <placeName key="berlin">the great city</placeName>.
                    Nobody mistrusts me. Nobody. I can carry my secret about with me in peace.
                    Nobody is betraying me. And it is a bright day with plenty of sunshine."</p>
                <p>Really tired, she clung to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s arm.
                        "<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>," she said at once, "<persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, you are not ashamed of me?"</p>
                <p>When <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> regarded her with surprise,
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> behaved as if something had flown in
                    her eye.</p>
                <p>"But what's the matter?"</p>
                <p>"Nothing, nothing; we go to <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName>
                    tomorrow, and I am glad <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> is going

                <p>This feeling of dread became so alarming during the last night before the
                    departure for <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName> that <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was obliged to summon the assistance of
                        <persName>the head nurse</persName>.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> wept and wept through many despairing hours.
                    "I cannot . . . I cannot. . . .How can I look <persName key="kreutz">Professor
                        Kreutz</persName> in the face? He doesn't know me. He doesn't know who I am.
                    I am afraid. I would rather die first." When at length she could weep no more,
                    she lay in her bed, staring in front of her.</p>
                <p>A thousand apprehensions assailed her. The railway journey to <placeName
                        key="dresden">Dresden</placeName>, all among strange people . . . the
                    arrival in another great city . . . the way to <placeName key="womensClinic">the
                        clinic</placeName> . . . more strange people, with curious eyes . . . and
                    then <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>. How would he receive
                    her?</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> did not know herself what was going on
                    within her.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had long since packed the trunks, had
                    found time for many cheery words, had talked about indifferent things, while
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was lying totally unconcerned.</p>
                <p>"And to-morrow I shall be with <persName key="kreutz">Professor
                    Kreutz</persName>, and nobody can help me—nobody." She kept saying these words
                    in a whisper. And when <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> told her that
                    she and <persName key="kreutz">Professor Kreutz</persName> had only a single
                    thought, which was to help her, and that it was ungrateful to despond just now,
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> only shook her head in a tired way.
                        "<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, I know better. Nobody can help
                    me. It is much too hard for a tired soul."</p>
                <p>In the morning, when <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was still
                    sleeping—she had not dropped off until very late—<persName key="lili"

                    softly, so as not to disturb <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, towards
                    the not very large mirror which <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had
                    brought with her and hung over the night table, converted into a dressing-table.
                    She was not pleased with what she saw. Ugly and inexpressive the reflection
                    appeared to her—a dull, tired,

                    mask. She sat down on a trunk and buried her face in her hands.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>!"
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s arms were round <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>'s neck. "Now you look like a mother anxious for
                    her child."</p>
                <p>"Anxious for her child?" <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> slowly repeated the
                    words. "Yes—for her ill-bred child, as if such a mother could ever be
                    cheerful."</p>
                <p>So the day started, and its hours crawled slowly by. <persName key="hvideNiels"
                        >Niels</persName> was an early arrival.</p>
                <p>"Our <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> looks like an officer's miss," he
                    cried, enthusiastic—"haughty and condescending! An incredible phenomenon."</p>
                <p>In half an hour the phenomenon will be on its way to its destination, <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> reflected. The phenomenon. And she pulled herself
                    together. Nobody should see tears in her eyes to-day. Nobody. She must empty her
                    mind of all thought. Thus she was driven to <placeName>the station</placeName>,
                    with eyes which looked as if they saw. But they saw nothing. In the waiting-room
                    she let herself be persuaded to take breakfast with the others. She was
                    obedient. "To-day I will have no will of my own, <persName key="hvideNiels"
                        >Niels</persName>; to-day I will do what you both order me."</p>
                <p>An abundant breakfast table was hastily improvised. "This spread," announced
                        <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> solemnly, "is to celebrate
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s departure on her first overland

                <p><persName>The waiter</persName> had placed a pint tankard of

                    the dainty, elegant <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, raised, not

                        >Lili</persName>—and <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was no

                <p>"Skaal, my dears," she said, "or prosit, as we must say here!" And before

                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s, she had taken a generous

                <p>"Bravo, bravo!" cried <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>, so loudly that
                    many of the people in the waiting-room looked around them.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> immediately put down her beaker. "Please,
                    please don't excite attention." She was stretched on the rack all the time.</p>
                <p>Yet she wanted to be gay. Moreover, as she honestly acknowledged, the fresh
                    aromatic beer had a glorious taste. And this refreshing breakfast with crusty
                        <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName> rolls and liver sausage and
                    cheese, a real German morning meal—did not in the least resemble an invalid's
                    diet.</p>
                <p>"It makes me feel quite a new being," she confessed. "It tastes like
                    resurrection. If only it gets to that point. Prosit! Long live life!"</p>
                <p>When it was time for the train to leave, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>,
                    clinging all the time to <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>' arm,

                <p>The landscape between <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName> and <placeName
                        key="dresden">Dresden</placeName> is a series of endless, monotonous plains,
                    thinly wooded, and here and there coloured red, white, and yellow by small
                    settlements, villages, townships and towns, broken only by occasional placid
                    brooks and streams—a picture devoid of excitement, a panorama calculated to
                    soothe and lull. Low overhead hung a blue-grey sky, while the fresh morning wind
                    drove golden clouds merrily before it like young lambs just released from the
                    fold. Then a large, bright green rectangle would swim into vision—a winter crop
                    with the ears already sprouting, between silvering willow trees, while a dark
                    islet of cloud lowered spectral overhead. Sharply defined on the eastern horizon
                    was a church tower. Then the sun emerged from a heavy bank of cloud, and flooded
                    the whole world with a golden light. The telegraph
                    wires<!--RJP:2018-04-6: Example of modernist reference--> buzzing up and down in
                    front of the carriage window. A flock of partridges ascending from a dark patch
                    of marshland and disappearing into a silvery birch wood. A signalman's cottage
                    with silver-birch trees and a few fruit trees, stunted and cropped, and
                    fluttering between them multi-coloured washing. A woman pressing her hands on
                    her hips, her eyes fixed on the train, beside her a fair child with a glaring
                    red ball in her hand, and a brown Pomeranian dog squatting beside the child.
                    Shoo—past! The woman's expression was plainly visible. A piece of blue-
                    and-white washing was waving like a flag in her right hand. An unpaved country
                    road curving towards the railway embankment. Two heavy farm-horses drawing a
                    heavily laden cart. The driver lashing out with the whip. The sun gilding <pb

                    bowl-pipe, lighting up even the puddles in the deep ruts of the cart-track.
                    Behind a far-flung ridge tower factory chimneys, and white and greenish-yellow
                    smoke-plumes wind into the blue until a breeze breaks them up and they become
                    golden clouds.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s eyes had become the eyes of a painter, and
                    a tremor passed through her. "Those are not my eyes. They are <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' eyes. Is he not yet dead within me? Can
                    he give me no peace, then?"</p>
                <p>She closed her eyes. She could not understand why she was so afraid to look at,
                    to grasp and to love the world, as <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    had done. Was it because she feared she would never get on to her own feet,
                    never be loosened from—<persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>?</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="hvideNiels"
                        >Niels</persName> had gone into the corridor in order to smoke.</p>
                <p>In the compartment there remained two German
                    gentlemen<!--RJP:2018-04-06: possible orgName--> of very correct appearance. The
                    two corner seats by the door belonged to them.</p>
                <p>Up till then <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> had scarcely noticed her
                    fellow-travellers. She had kept herself entrenched behind newspapers.</p>
                <p>Suddenly <persName>one of the gentlemen</persName> laid his paper down and <persName>the other
                        gentleman</persName> followed suit, except that he almost solemnly folded up
                    his newspaper. Involuntarily she looked at him, and he returned her look very
                    deliberately. "Hm!" he grunted at least four times. <persName>The other
                        gentleman</persName> flicked off some dust, and removed his light-brown,
                    very solid gloves. A thick diamond ring came to light. He cleared his throat
                    again. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> drew her furs closer about her. She

                    very haughty expression.</p>
                <p>"Ahem," said <persName>the gentleman next to her</persName>. "Do you mind,
                        madam?" She nodded her assent.</p>
                <p>He offered her a heavy cigarette-case, inlaid with gold: "It is, to be sure, a
                    non-smoker; but both the other people—ahem."</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> smiled: "No, thanks."</p>
                <p>"Hm!" And <persName>the gentleman</persName> shut his case with a snap and
                    deliberately put it away in his pocket.</p>
                <p><persName>The gentleman opposite</persName> unfolded his newspaper.</p>
                <p>And <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> looked out of the window.</p>
                <p>A little dainty birch wood upon a hill under the sun. Two diminutive
                    mother-o'-pearl clouds overhead, like wings which a child angel had forgotten in
                    play.</p>
                <p><persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> had returned, and was again sitting
                    in his corner seat.</p>
                <p>"Early spring," he said; "early spring, <persName key="lili"

                <p>And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, who also returned at this moment,
                    repeated the word, "Early spring. . . . I never heard the word

                <p>Then she broke off, avoided <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s look, and
                    closed her eyes.</p>
                <p>For a whole hour they sat thus silent.</p>

                <p>Was it jealousy which was now stirring in her?</p>
                <p>No, no; the idea was impossible.</p>
                <p>She leaned across to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>—no one saw it,

                    had fallen asleep like <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, while the two
                    strange gentlemen<!--RJP:2018-04-06: possible orgName--> were standing outside
                    in the corridor smoking—and laid her hand in <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>'s lap. Then she rose and sat next to <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, laid her head against <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s shoulder and gazed out of the window
                    again. Ranges of hills were billowing up, growing into small mountains, and new
                    ones kept joining them, dotted with villas. And eventually everything became a
                    confusion of villas and gardens and tenement houses—between which factory
                    buildings reared their heads and streets opened like canals between columns of

                    life. Trams, cars, people, clamouring

                    on blank walls, a wide ramification of railway lines on either side, trains with
                    an endless line of coaches, a station on the right hand and the left hand, a
                    continuous shuddering of the carriage as it slid rumblingly past the points.</p>
                <p>Then the train stopped.</p>
                <p><persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> woke up.</p>
                <p>"Shall we soon be there?" asked <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>.</p>

                <p>When the train started again, all three of them were standing at the window. Now
                    they were crossing <placeName>the long bridge, under which <placeName

                    like a glistening velvet ribbon, and <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> saw

                    emerge from the shimmering water-surface. Slowly she looked up and saw that it
                    was no phantasmagoria—<placeName key="dresden">this magnificent city on

                <p>She knelt on her seat and stared out and drank in the picture of this place of
                    pilgrimage, longed for so ardently and vouchsafed her in return for so much
                    suffering. And her eyes became too full and too heavy. She closed them, and
                    pressed her hands against her heart. The tears she wept were the soft tears of
                    faith. A feeling of boundless happiness flooded her whole being. "Now I am home
                    . . . now I shall soon be home."</p>
                <p><persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> laid his hand on her shoulder.

                <p>"It is only for happiness, <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was standing beside her. She could
                    find no word to utter, but many tears to shed.</p>
                <p>How <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> got out of the compartment, how she made
                    her entry into <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName> in a taxi-cab, she
                    could never afterwards remember.</p>
                <p>It was a long drive. Soon the streets of the city lay behind them, and they were
                    traversing the residential districts. They passed a block of tall buildings,
                    then suddenly the cab turned round a corner. Slender, white, gleaming birch
                    trees raised their filagree-fine branches above a garden wall, behind which
                    towered a grey, solemn, massive block of buildings, comprised of many
                    houses.</p>
                <p>"Stop, stop!" cried <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. "Here we are!"</p>
                <p>The next moment the cab stopped in front of a porch, which bore in large letters
                    the inscription:</p>
                <p>"<placeName key="womensClinic">MUNICIPAL WOMEN'S CLINIC</placeName>."</p>
                <p>"How could you know that?" asked <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and
                        <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>, as they were helping <persName

                        >Lili</persName> was pale as death. She heard the pealing of the hospital

                <p><persName>A white-clad nurse</persName> hailed them from the window of the

                <p>The elderly nurse was <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName>. She was
                    bidding farewell to a patient.</p>
                <p>Then she received the three

                    with great cordiality, and ushered them into a long hospital corridor. Twilight
                    had already set in, and through the glass panes of a large folding-door at the
                    end of the corridor fell a soft sea-green shimmer, which was reflected on the
                    polished floor and the many white-lacquered doors.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> will be with you in a moment,"
                    said <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName>.</p>
                <p>Near the large folding-door were a few armchairs and a small table, illuminated
                    by a lamp, where a doctor in a white smock was conversing with two ladies.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> seized <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>'s hand. "That's <persName key="kreutz">Professor

                <p>"You are mistaken, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>," said <persName
                        key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName>. "Besides, you have never seen him. Surely

                <p>"<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> is right. It is <persName

                        >Lili</persName> with a trembling voice.</p>

                <p>While he was conducting the two ladies to the office, he remained standing a
                    moment and greeted the newcomers with ceremonious politeness, after which he
                    requested them to sit down.</p>
                <p>They all seated themselves about the round table. <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> had relapsed into silence. White-clad nurses came and went
                    and said good day. But <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> had eyes and ears
                    for nothing.</p>
                <p>Only when the door of the office opened again and the two ladies were ushered out
                    by <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>, did she become wide
                    awake.</p>
                <p><persName key="matron">The Matron</persName> made a sign to them, and <persName

                    >Lili</persName>'s hand. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> remained
                    sitting in the armchair.</p>
                <p>Two months before <persName key="kreutz">Professor Kreutz</persName> had seen
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> in <placeName key="paris"
                        >Paris</placeName> on a single occasion. Now <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> stood in front of him for the first time. <persName
                        key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> led her into the office, and then went
                    out again to welcome <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, who had suddenly become very calm, looked
                    about her in the room. It was a large apartment and might have been a study or
                    an operating-room. In front of the large window, which gave a view of the birch
                    trees in <placeName>the garden</placeName>, stood a chair for patients, and in
                    front of one wall was a writing-desk, full of papers. Everything in the room was
                    dazzling white.</p>
                <p>When <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> returned, he sat down
                    opposite <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. She began to chat about her stay
                    in <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>. Suddenly he interrupted her with
                    a question. His rather stern face broke into a smile.</p>
                <p>"Did <persName key="arns">Professor Arns</persName> acquaint you with the result
                    of his chemical and miscroscopical examination?<choice>

                <p>"No, <persName key="kreutz">Professor</persName>."</p>
                <p>"Well, then, I can tell you the welcome news <pb n="188"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="162"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> that all the examinations gave the most
                    favourable results. Everything confirms our assumption."</p>
                <p>She breathed again. She was relieved of the necessity of explanations.</p>
                <p>She listened to his peculiar velvety voice. A feeling of happiness stole over
                    her. <persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> spoke so sympathetically
                    about everything that affected her that she grew courageous, and suddenly began
                    to relate her experience with <persName key="karner">Dr. Karner</persName> in
                        <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>. But when she looked up she gazed
                    into <persName key="kreutz">Professor Kreutz</persName>' eyes, those eyes that
                    were light and dark at the same time, and her words died on her lips. She could
                    not utter another syllable. It flashed upon her that <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had been able to talk quite freely to <persName
                        key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> in <placeName key="paris"
                        >Paris</placeName>. Why could she not do so?</p>
                <p><persName key="kreutz">Professor Kreutz</persName> regarded her inquiringly, and
                    waited for her to proceed with her story. When, however, she failed to do so, he
                    broke the silence.</p>
                <p>"I really intended you to come into the private ward immediately, but, in a most
                    unexpected fashion, every bed is at the moment occupied. This is, perhaps, just
                    as well, as we must wait a little before the operation is performed. I am
                    looking out for a pair of particularly good glands for you."</p>
                <p>At this realistic argument <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> shuddered. She
                    did not know where to turn her eyes. She was overwhelmed with shame, and utterly
                    embarrassed.</p>
                <p><persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> seemed hardly to notice this, for
                    he continued calmly:</p>
                <p>"Besides, it will do you nothing but good to spend a few days in <placeName>the
                        hotel</placeName>, and see the town and our <placeName>museum</placeName>.
                    Moreover, you could do some painting. You will find plenty of subjects here.

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="163"/> At these words <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    seemed to lose all her moral support. The idea of not being immediately received
                    into <placeName key="womensClinic">the clinic</placeName>, but stopping for days
                    in a strange hotel, appeared to her as monstrous as an undeserved punishment.
                    She wanted to beg <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> to be allowed
                    to remain there, she wanted to rebel against his decision. She looked
                    imploringly at <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>, but could find
                    nothing to say except:</p>
                <p>"Very well, <persName key="kreutz">Professor</persName>."</p>
                <p>This ended the interview. <persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> held
                    out his hand, and went out of the room with her to <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>. He mentioned <placeName>an hotel in the vicinity of

                    and bade her good-bye very formally.</p>
                <p>Utterly disconcerted, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> met <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. She felt as if she had suffered a
                    disastrous defeat. A single glance of this man had deprived her of all her
                    strength. She felt as if her whole personality had been crushed by him. With a
                    single glance he had extinguished it. Something within her rebelled. She felt
                    like a schoolgirl who had received short shrift from an idolized teacher. She
                    heard <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>'s voice ringing in her
                    ear. She was conscious of a peculiar weakness in all her members. She stood
                    there as if in a fog and apprehended nothing. But later, when she recalled this
                    moment, she found an explanation: it was the first time her woman's heart had
                    trembled before her lord and master, before the man who had constituted himself
                    her protector, and she understood why she then submitted so utterly to him and
                    his will.</p>

                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. She imagines that she has an ugly and
                    disagreeable appearance, and that every normal person must be repelled by her.
                    She weeps perpetually. We have gone out on a number of occasions, but, dominated
                    by her fixed idea, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> thought she could read
                    in every glance of the passers-by a confirmation of <persName key="kreutz"
                        >Professor Kreutz</persName>'s aversion. It goes without saying that we
                    foreigners should attract attention here in <placeName key="dresden"
                        >Dresden</placeName>, but she blames herself entirely. She is indignant
                    because <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> suggested that she
                    should do some painting in the interval. That was the worst thing he could have
                    said. Everything that relates to <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> is
                    detested by her, but especially painting."</p>

                <p>The following day <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> wrote in her
                    diary:</p>
                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c12d02p01">"<persName key="hvideNiels"
                        >Niels</persName> was certainly quite right when he said that what <persName
                        key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> is now doing with <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> is nothing less than an emotional moulding, which is
                    preceding the physical moulding into a woman. Hitherto <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> has been like clay which others had prepared and to which
                        <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> has given form and life by a
                    transient touch. Up till now, he thought, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s
                    femininity has been only superficial, not yet completely wholly genuine. By a
                    single glance <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> yesterday awoke
                    her heart to life, to a life with all the instincts of woman. The more I ponder
                    over this, the more heartily I agree with <persName key="hvideNiels"
                        >Niels</persName>. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> is now silent and
                    completely wrapped up in herself. True, she still weeps softly to herself at
                    times; but those are the tears of nostalgia. She does not know herself what is
                    happening to her, and I can do nothing more than assist her with encouraging
                    words and patience."</p>
                <p>The next page contained the following entry:</p>
                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c12d03p01">"<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    said to me last night: 'It is certainly unjust of me to think bitterly of
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, but sometimes I am obliged to
                    think of him, and then I do not quite know what to call him. I think I must call
                    him my dead brother, and to this I must get accustomed. So much so that I cannot
                    any longer realize that he and I have dwelt in the same body and <choice>

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> belongs to me alone.' Then she said: 'Perhaps I
                    am the murderer of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, and this idea
                    tortures me fearfully, as I surmise that I shall perhaps be of much less value
                    than he. He was a creative person. He was a painter, with a long record behind
                    him. And just because of this I am afraid of wanting to achieve anything. For if
                    I should really once paint and then perceive that my performance fell below his,
                    this would completely upset me, and I would commit suicide!' Suddenly she said:
                        '<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, I see in front of me the
                    clothes of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> which we left behind in
                        <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>. I see every article of clothing.
                    And I think of them at night. And I am afraid to go to sleep again, lest I
                    should dream that I was slipping these clothes on."'</p>
                <p>Thus a whole week passed. A deep melancholy hung over <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>, and this melancholy deepened into an icy horror when one
                    morning a number of letters from <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName>, addressed to <persName key="sparreAn">Monsieur
                        Andreas Sparre</persName> of <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>,
                    arrived from <placeName key="womensClinic">the Women's Clinic</placeName>. She
                    would not even touch the letters. Even <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was not allowed to read the letters. <persName
                        key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> had to burn them. And now <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> was convinced that she would never be able to
                    enter <placeName key="womensClinic">the Women's Clinic</placeName>.</p>
                <p>"The letters have made it impossible. Let us disappear from here," implored
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> without tears, firmly resolved to
                    efface herself in silence. Then, like a release, came news from <placeName
                        key="womensClinic">the Women's Clinic</placeName> that a room was now free
                    for <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, and <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> went with her the short distance to <placeName
                        key="womensClinic">the hospital</placeName>.</p>
                <p>The next day <persName key="hvideNiels">Niels</persName> returned to <placeName

                <head>XIII</head>
                <p>Many times <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> tried to recall the first moments
                    she spent in <placeName key="womensClinic">the Women's Clinic</placeName>, and
                    every time she felt again the infinite peace which had then settled upon her
                    distracted spirit. A ray of hope, which, like a Bachian hymn, was carried by
                    angel voices to an invisible vault.</p>
                <p>All anxiety and unrest fell away from her. Her own life appeared to her of
                    secondary importance, and so valueless. An obscure feeling inspired her with
                    devotion, a feeling of participating in something new and great, something that
                    transcended everything that came within the range of ordinary experience. A
                    white sick-room,<!--end of line, but hyphen kept to match waiting-room, etc.-->
                    brightened by the green reflection from <placeName>the garden</placeName>. A
                    white bed. Upon a white table mysterious shining instruments and forceps under a
                    glass case. An odour of ether and formalin over everything. Visits from
                        <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName>, a well-preserved motherly
                    woman in white nurse's uniform with starched white cap on her silver-grey hair.
                    Now and again, penetrating through the folding-door a muffled noise, gradually
                    dying down—the sound of invalid carriages rolling past. And in the white room
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Now and then soft voices and
                    footfalls. The door is opened, a slender figure in a white coat enters, and
                    remains standing in the room.</p>
                <p>Of this first visit of <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>
                    <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> retained <pb n="193"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="168"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> only an almost musical recollection. A voice. A
                    vision. What he said to her faded right out of her mind. But from the moment he
                    stood before her in the white sick-room, all her burdens slipped away. And her
                    whole being was flooded with assurance and joyous hope.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> went out under the birch trees in
                        <placeName>the large garden</placeName><!--key unkonwn--> and waited.
                        <persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> had told her that everything
                    would be ready for the operation within a day or two.</p>
                <p>The white trees gleamed silvery upon the shining green borders. Their branches
                    stood out against the grey, quivering atmosphere as if bathed in a reddish
                    sheen. Here and there hedges and bushes with their branches still bare. Silky
                    catkins on the few willow trees, and here and there yellow buds. And many seats
                    along the paths. White-clad sisters resting after lunch greeted <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> and <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.
                    And in the middle of <placeName>the large garden</placeName> a bevy of young,
                    pregnant women. They were laughing joyously and happily, and in their blue
                    hospital clothes looked like big crocuses just sprung up.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>," said <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, "now I understand the beautiful German word
                    'fore-spring'. Everything here is so full of expectation."</p>
                <p>Then a slender man in white overalls hastened across <placeName>the
                    park</placeName> to the septic station. <persName>An assistant
                        doctor</persName> followed him, and a whisper flew from mouth to mouth:
                        "<persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName>." All eyes were riveted on
                    him, and everything seemed to stop for a moment.</p>
                <p>And then the turret clock of <placeName key="womensClinic">the clinic</placeName>
                    struck. Six o'clock. It was time to return to one's room. <placeName>The
                        park</placeName> was already dark. Arm in arm <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> and <pb n="194"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="169"/>
                    <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> went slowly into the large house. The
                    lights were burning in the broad, white corridors. Young nurses in white
                    uniforms, with white, tight-fitting caps, were bringing the patients' evening
                    meal. Down below, in front of <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>'s
                    room, stood <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName>. Suddenly his voice
                    sounded through the open door, and <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    shuddered. In a fright she drew <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> with
                    her round the corner into the corridor whereon her room was situated.</p>
                <p>"What's the matter?" asked <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Hurry," whispered <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, breathless, and slipped
                    into her room. An inexplicable fear had gripped her at the sound of <persName
                        key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>'s voice. Once again she felt like a
                    schoolgirl! The next evening, when <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was put
                    to bed, she was subjected to all the ceremonies that precede an operation. And
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> sat beside her to offer
                    encouragement. <persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> had already
                    intimated in the morning that if <persName>a young woman</persName> who had to
                    be operated upon the following day possessed suitable ovaries, the
                    transplantation should be effected forthwith. Excited and happy she bade
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> farewell this evening. She lay
                    awake for hours and stared into the white room. The night-lamp diffused a
                    subdued light. <persName key="nurseHannah">Nurse Hannah</persName>, young and
                    pretty, sat beside her, conversed with her, placed a sleeping-draught on the
                    night table, and then softly disappeared.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> did not take the sleeping-draught. She was
                    afraid of sleeping too long. She wanted to be wide awake when next morning, her
                    great morning, came.</p>
                <p>Not another sound was heard from the corridors. Everything was drowned in the
                    silence of the night. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s thoughts were
                    suffused with gentle light. <pb n="195"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="170"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> It seemed to her as if she no longer had any
                    responsibility for herself, for her fate. For <persName key="kreutz">Werner
                        Kreutz</persName> had relieved her of it all. Nor had she any longer a will
                    of her own.</p>
                <p>And suddenly she thought of the past, of <placeName key="paris"
                    >Paris</placeName>. Yet the next moment she fled from this recollection. There
                    could be no past for her. Everything in the past belonged to a person who had
                    vanished, who was dead. How altogether different from her <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas Sparre</persName> had been! Now there was only a
                    perfectly humble woman, who was ready to obey, who was happy to submit herself
                    to the will of another.</p>
                <p>The turret clock chimed again. She heard it many times that night.</p>
                <p>When the first streaks of dawn came stealing through the curtains, <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> was already wide awake. It was six o'clock, and
                    at seven o'clock <persName key="nurseHannah">sister Hannah</persName> came in
                    and prepared her for the operation. Then there was a long, tedious wait, during
                    which she hardly dared to move. She strained her ears for every step in the
                    corridor, every sound that penetrated thence, and every noise; but nobody
                    stopped outside her door. Had they forgotten her?</p>
                <p>At length <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> came into the room and
                    conveyed to her the doleful news that she must wait yet a few days longer, as
                        <persName>the invalid</persName> in question who had been operated upon had
                    "yielded no suitable material" for <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p>Disappointment and suspense would have brought her to the verge of tears if
                        <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> had not informed her at the
                    same time that she was to be allotted a new room which had a large window
                    overlooking <placeName>the garden</placeName> and a sunny aspect. <pb n="196"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="171"/> And when <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    arrived a few minutes later the removal to the new room was immediately
                    begun.</p>
                <p>Again they strolled arm in arm through <placeName>the park of <placeName
                            key="womensClinic">the Women's Clinic</placeName></placeName>. How
                    quickly everything here had become familiar to them, even the white-clad nurses,
                    whose morning greetings they gratefully acknowledged! And <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> smiled happily on the young pregnant women in the crocus
                    costumes. Now and then young doctors passed, and they too wished her: "Good
                    morning, madam."</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was happy. Here she was walking quite
                    naturally like a young woman among other young women. She was a creature without
                    any past. Had she ever looked any different from now? She smiled. Then suddenly
                    she saw <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> in her mind's eye, how he
                    had regarded charming and elegantly dressed women in <placeName key="paris"
                        >Paris</placeName>, and had almost envied them their elegance. How dull and
                    insipid, he had often said, was male attire! Now all this was past and
                    over—obliterated as if by a gesture of her master, her creator, <persName
                        key="kreutz">her Professor</persName>. There was no longer an <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>; he could never return. Now between him
                    and her stood <persName key="kreutz">Werner Kreutz</persName>. She felt secure
                    and salvaged.</p>
                <p>Here in this little state within a state men ruled with absolute power, with
                        <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> at their head. <persName
                        key="matron">The Matron</persName> was the single exception. In spite of her
                    maternal benevolence, she was a very decisive lady, whose energetic profile
                    under the silver-grey hair might recall <persName key="bourbons">the
                        Bourbons</persName> in their splendid period. Her personality compelled
                    respect—she was the only person in <placeName key="womensClinic">the Women's
                        Clinic</placeName> who enjoyed, to a certain extent, the confidence of

                    after to-morrow,<!--end of line, but hyphen kept to match style--> the operation
                    could be performed.</p>
                <p>"Tell me, <persName key="matron">Matron</persName>," asked <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> abruptly, "why are really healthy ovaries removed from a

                <p>"But, <persName key="lili">Miss Lili</persName>," answered <persName key="matron"
                        >the Matron</persName>, "it would take too long to explain this to you,
                    especially as you do not possess the necessary anatomical knowledge to

                    Moreover, you need not have any fear, as your operation will be quite a minor
                    one."</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> laughed.</p>
                <p>"I have no fear at all, <persName key="matron">Matron</persName>. In <placeName

                    nearly an hour and a half on the operating-table. Whether this new operation is
                    dangerous or harmless does not bother me in the least. I have not come here to
                    die. Of that I feel certain. I could have done this without the help of

                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s voice trembled with excitement. "Is it
                    really true, <persName key="matron">Matron</persName>, that the age of a woman
                    is determined by her ovaries? Is that really the decisive factor for a

                <p>"Yes, of course. Why have I not done so long ago? I will ask him this very

                <p>But when <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> asked on the following

                    her curiosity, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> felt very ashamed. "No," she

                <p><persName key="matron">The Matron</persName> lifted her forefinger and laughingly
                    threatened: "Why not say quite honestly that you did not dare to do so!"</p>
                <p>"No, I did not dare to do so," confessed <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. </p>

                <p>Two days later <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> filled many pages of

                    was quietly sleeping. She had been given a morphia injection. I cautiously

                    came out of the operating-theatre. Everybody spoke softly. A strange stillness
                    reigned in the broad, white corridor. A greenish light drifted through the high
                    window, through which could be seen the still bare trees of <placeName>the
                        park</placeName>, and, lit up by the morning sun, the wing in which
                        <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>'s quarters were situated. A
                    covered gangway connected the first storey with the main department of
                        <placeName key="womensClinic">the clinic</placeName>. Thence all eyes were

                    and stared continuously out of the window at <persName key="kreutz">the

                    Everything around me was in commotion. I saw <persName key="kreutz">the
                        Professor</persName> approaching <placeName key="womensClinic">the

                    greeting everybody with a polite, 'Good morning'. He was very ceremonious and
                    unapproachable, even towards me, although we had always been on very friendly
                    terms. I did not venture to address him, nor even to follow him, when, in
                    company with <persName>the head doctor</persName> and <persName key="matron">the

                    in. I was no doubt very pale. The air was of spring-like warmth. A few birds
                    were singing in the trees. A golden haze hung over them, and a soft wind blew

                    movable table, handed it in, and the door noiselessly closed again. Soon the
                    sickly smell of ether escaped from the room and penetrated everywhere. I felt as
                    if I were going to faint; but I pulled myself together.</p>
                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c13d01p05">"An endless time seemed to elapse, and

                    'Don't worry,' he said softly, and disappeared to make further visits. The

                    face. . . it lay under the ether mask. Then the white procession disappeared
                    along the white corridor into the operating-theatre. How long would it last? I
                    kept saying to myself: Don't think, don't think. What are they doing now to this

                    higher Power. And I thought of this man, whom I had recently tried to paint.</p>
                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c13d01p07">"And now I realized how all my powers had
                    been bent upon an effort to retain this masculine head in a portrait. What power

                        Women's Clinic</placeName> was a god, whom all feared, whom all revered. In
                    what did his power consist? And I recalled his face. Was it really handsome? No;
                    strange, rather. No feature of his face was really handsome. Everything, even
                    the eyes, were irregular. And yet a striking harmony characterized the whole, a
                    force, an emanation of force. For days I had tried to capture this face, to
                    retain it in many hasty sketches. I knew all his attitudes, all his movements.
                    This armchair had been my daily observation-post. Opposite his office. I knew
                    precisely the time he came and the time he went. His visiting times, and his
                    promenades through the rooms.</p>

                    advance towards me, his hands outstretched and a stern smile playing about his
                    lips. Every time I had seen this smile I had felt as if I must weep. I had seen

                    him! Yesterday, in the centre of the town, among strange people, I had a vision

                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c13d01p09">"But why, whence came this feeling? And
                    then I told myself that I was only one of the many who believed in this man
                    through the mere force of belief, who believed in the helper in him through
                    their belief in some kind of helper. As I now sat here in the armchair in the
                    white corridor I realized that my feeling for this man was nothing less than the
                    feeling which <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> cherished for him in the
                    deepest recesses of her heart. With her it is certainly still slumbering, for
                    she is as yet merely a vague being. <hi rend="italics">Vorfrühling</hi>: early
                    spring! This word suddenly sounded like music to my ears. Would <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> really see it?</p>
                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c13d01p20">"I was still sitting with closed eyes
                    when suddenly the door of the operating theatre was flung open and <persName
                        key="kreutz">Werner Kreutz</persName> was standing in front of me . . .
                    still in the indiarubber apron. His gait was tired. He held out both his hands
                    and gave me a broad, benevolent smile. I only heard his words: 'Everything has
                    passed off well.' I clasped both his hands. And I could only stammer: 'I thank
                    you.'</p>
                <p style="GreteDiary" xml:id="a1c13d01p11">"Not until a few hours later did I learn
                    what had happened inside. To find words in which to put it is unspeakably

                    me as I write these words. A human being who was born a man, who was my husband,
                    my friend, my comrade—has now become a woman, a complete woman. And this human
                    being was never intended to be anything but a woman. Like a sacrificial animal
                    he has been dragged along with me for years until <persName key="kreutz"
                        >this German doctor</persName> brought him help! And to-day this human being has
                    laid here bleeding under the knife of his helper. His body was opened, and
                    disclosed a state of things which the craziest imagination would hardly have
                    considered possible. The body of this human being contained stunted and withered
                    ovaries which were not able to develop because an inscrutable Fate had also
                    given him the others, the male germ glands. This secret of existing as a double
                    being, hitherto divined by no doctor, has only been unveiled to-day, after
                        <persName key="kreutz">Werner Kreutz</persName> had guessed at its existence
                    in <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>, and like a wizard deciphered
                    it.</p>

                    express my meaning. And now this poor creature, so heavily handicapped by Fate,
                    has had removed from its body what had formed such an obstacle, thus enabling it
                    now to develop as its blood had dictated for years, namely, as a woman, and it
                    has been equipped with unimpaired female germ glands from another, <persName>a strange and quite young creature</persName>.<!--id will be the same as the twenty seven year old woman donor.-->

                    became earnest, most mysteriously earnest. But I must not think of this now; I

                    rift in the drawn window-curtains. Then her eyes closed again and she slept long
                    and heavily. When she awoke again, it seemed as if <pb n="207"/>

                    bed, in front of the window, she had seen the silhouette of <persName
                        key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>, and beside him <persName>the head
                        doctor</persName>. <persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> had asked
                    something. Good! "Have you a good bite?"</p>
                <p>She had answered with a humble: "No, <persName key="kreutz"
                    >Professor</persName>," suppressing with difficulty a smile.</p>
                <p>And then <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> had ordered: "Count.
                    Either in Danish or French, just as you like."</p>
                <p>She had started counting in German: "One, two, three," when an ether mask had
                    been slipped over her face. She found it difficult to breathe. She went on
                    counting: "Four, five, six, seven." The counting became harder and slower. When
                    she came to eighteen, she felt as if she were suffocating. She heard the voice
                    of <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>: "Twenty, twenty-one,
                    twenty-two . . ."</p>

                    which grew louder and louder, until everything became one continuous buzz and
                    she lost consciousness. Was it a dream?' Or had she been stupefied? But why had
                    they left her lying here so long without operating upon her? Until she had
                    awakened with this unpleasant ether taste in her mouth? "You haven't any
                    bite?"</p>
                <p>She heard this question again. But the smile gave way to a terrible pain. With a
                    shriek she opened her eyes. <persName key="matron">The Matron</persName> was
                    standing beside <choice>

                    whispering: "You've come through all right. It went off splendidly. Now
                    everything is going on well." But her eyes had already closed again, and she was
                    sleeping. When she was awakened again by pains which became more and more acute,
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was standing <pb n="208"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="181"/> beside her with a bunch of red tulips. <persName>A
                        nurse</persName> came in, gave her an injection, and she went off to sleep
                    again. Once <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> stood beside her,
                    held her hand, and said something that she did not understand. But she saw his
                    eyes, and with a drowsy feeling sank into oblivion again.</p>
                <p>That day and the night which followed it were passed in the mists of morphia.
                    When she awoke, the pains were there, but <persName>a sister</persName> was also
                    beside her with a morphia syringe. She was conscious of acute thirst. Moist
                    cotton-wool was laid upon the parched mouth. But the injections of morphia
                    caused even thirst to be forgotten.</p>
                <p>Thus morning came. Everything had really passed off very well, and peaceful,
                    natural sleep soon enfolded her again. The following days stole by softly and
                    mistily. If she was attacked by pain, it was repelled by narcotics. If she
                    opened her eyes, she would stare in front of her as if astonished at everything
                    that had happened to her. Gradually she became accustomed even to the pain; she
                    told herself that these pains were the price to be paid for what had been
                    bestowed upon her, her own life, her woman's life. The prospect was fair and
                    hopeful. Her white room in <placeName key="womensClinic">the Women's
                        Clinic</placeName> seemed to her like an earthly paradise. <persName
                        key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> was the guardian of her paradise.
                    Morning and evening he stopped for a few moments by her bedside. Between these
                    visits all was expectation.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was always at hand during these days.
                    From the door leading to <placeName>the garden</placeName> she painted the white
                    birch trees and the garden paths. If she saw <persName key="kreutz">the
                        Professor</persName> coming, she would hurry back to <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>.</p>

                <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                <p>It was only of the nights that <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was afraid.
                    Then <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was far away, and the flowers
                    which she had brought had been removed from the room. Flowers had also come from
                        <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>, from <persName key="rossiniEl"
                        >Elena</persName>, and from <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>.
                    And letters—these letters were the sole companions of her long, long nights. And
                    the turret clock striking the hours. And . . . the pains! They started almost
                    regularly every night. Her bed would then become a glowing oven. She would lay
                    there bathed in perspiration. <persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName>
                    had ordered her to sleep; but she was to have no more morphia. Other sedatives
                    were administered to her; but they were effective only for a few hours. Then she
                    would lay awake watching for daybreak.</p>
                <p>And the day became fair again, and again there was the feeling of blissful
                    expectation. She listened for every footfall—she had long since been able to
                    detect the footfall of her helper amidst all other footfalls. But he did not
                    always stop at her door. Other patients had need of him. Then she would wait
                    patiently until her turn came. Here in <placeName key="womensClinic">the
                        clinic</placeName> everybody was waiting for <persName key="kreutz">the
                        Professor</persName>. Everybody had to share in him, and each woman received
                    her share, even if it were only a tiny share. When he smiled she forgot all her
                    pain. Sometimes he was strict, and then she felt a mystical fear of him. And she
                    divined that he behaved quite differently towards her than towards <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. He never hinted at the past by so much as
                    a word. Was she only <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> for him? Sometimes she
                    felt a craving to ask him about it, but she never dared to do so.</p>
                <p>And for hours she would lie there and ponder <pb n="210"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>

                    had deprived her of her will. She observed how he sought to evoke her feminine
                    impulses by being alternately mild and stern. Had he not deliberately provoked
                    an eruption of all the primitive instincts of her womanhood? She felt the
                    transformation proceeding with every new day. It was a new life. It was a new
                    youth. It was her own youth that was seeking to liberate itself. And she lay

                        >Lili</persName>'s assistance. Yet she must still pass many days chained to
                    the bed, in the white sick-room. But with each new day her life became
                    healthier. The pains departed. Everything took a normal course. <persName
                        key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> was satisfied. She was still utterly
                    exhausted. And hence it came about that she lay as if wrapt in a coma, and she
                    spent most of the day absorbed in herself and dreaming. The world outside did
                    not trouble her. She was hardly aware of it. Newspapers and books which were
                    brought to her she left untouched. She had only one wish: that nothing should
                    ever be different, that she could always remain here, in the peace of <placeName
                        key="womensClinic">the Women's Clinic</placeName>. And when the thought
                    sometimes occurred to her that the day would come when she would have to go
                    forth into the world outside, beyond the park wall of <placeName
                        key="womensClinic">this large, quiet house</placeName>, she was assailed by
                    overwhelming fear. Thus she developed a desire to remain here as a nurse, to
                    build up her strength in order to be able to help other women once she was well.
                    Now and then she broached the matter to <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> or to <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName>, or the
                    other nurses, who merely nodded. Once she asked <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> if she might not speak to <persName key="kreutz">the

                    <pb style="page" n="185"/> fresh fear welled up in her. "If he should say no!
                    Perhaps I shall not be strong enough. Perhaps he will tell me that he did not
                    save me for this. . . ." And <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had no
                    answer.</p>
                <p>During many long nights <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s fear of life
                    outside sought refuge in another peaceful thought. Could she not enter a
                    convent, become a nun? She fell into reveries of remote, secluded convents
                    somewhere in <placeName key="italy">Italy</placeName>, <placeName key="spain"
                        >Spain</placeName>, or <placeName key="germanySouth">South
                        Germany</placeName>. No one should know there whence she had come and what a
                    destiny had been hers. No one. . . . She would weep for hours for fear of the
                    life outside, of this life which seemed to her like an enemy. There her secret
                    would be rudely unveiled, and she would be regarded as a phenomenon. Her fate
                    would be the subject of vulgar gossip; she would be stared at, and she would not
                    be left in peace. And the healthier her body became, the more vivid became her
                    fear of her future among people. Yet she no longer dared to speak about it to
                    others.</p>
                <p>At length the morning came when she was allowed to leave the sick-room for the
                    first time. Lying back in a bath-chair she was pushed into the warm, sunny April
                    morning, into the middle of <placeName>a soft green
                    garden</placeName>.<!--strange that this is indefinite. Not sure if we should tag the same way as the Clinic's garden.-->
                    It was her first untrammelled, happy day. She was like a newborn babe. All her
                    senses were fresh and full of wonder. She saw every insect which fluttered in
                    the blue sunny air and every flapping of wings from tree to tree. The scent of
                    the little yellow pink-and-white spring flowers of the hedges and borders held a
                    new message for her. And with attentive eyes she regarded a magnolia tree
                    holding up its large, glistening buds to the sunny air. Upon a branch <pb

                    </choice>
                    <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> closed her eyes. A soft wind played about
                    the white birch trees. The spring soil smelt sweet and warm. The birds
                    twittered.</p>
                <p>To keep her eyes shut, only to listen, only to smell. More than this she could
                    not do. In this posture <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> found
                    her. "You look very happy," he said, and patted her hand.</p>
                <p>"My life is your work," she reflected. "And I should so much like to thank you
                    for the first spring day of my life, because you were merciful to me. I believe
                    I am the happiest creature in the world." But all this remained unspoken; she
                    felt it only in her heart.</p>
                <p>"You look happy," said <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>, and she
                    merely answered:</p>
                <p>"Yes, <persName key="kreutz">Professor</persName>."</p>
                <p>Many happy spring days came, and at last the day also came when she could be
                    lifted out of the invalid's chair and walk a few steps in <placeName>the
                        garden</placeName> on <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s arm.
                    Everything was as before, and yet everything seemed so changed, she thought. And
                    on all the paths she saw again young, pregnant women, like blue crocuses, as she
                    thought, smiling.</p>
                <p>One morning, before she had strolled out into <placeName>the park</placeName>,
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="matron">the
                        Matron</persName> came into her room and handed her a sealed letter, which
                    had come from <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>. She opened the letter,
                    and a profound emotion overwhelmed her. A few weeks before <persName
                        key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> had told her that he would assist her
                    to confront the world for what she was, a woman. He had promised her to write to
                        <placeName>the Danish Embassy in <placeName key="berlin"
                        >Berlin</placeName></placeName>.<!--id unknown but needs to be added--> Now
                    she took from the envelope a passport, her own passport with her <pb n="214"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="187"/> own photograph, and upon the passport was written the
                    name which she had chosen out of gratitude to the city where she had found peace
                    and life itself: <persName key="lili">Lili Elbe</persName>.</p>
                <p>She sank into the chair and said very softly: "Leave me alone now for a little
                    while." <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="matron"
                        >the Matron</persName> understood and went out. For a long time <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> remained sitting very quietly on the chair. She
                    then went softly and diffidently into <placeName>the park</placeName>, and sat
                    on a seat which was flooded by sunshine. This little booklet, her passport, she
                    held like a valuable present in both hands. It was the last day but one of
                    April. In two days it would be the first of May. <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had kept his promise. He was dead, and she was
                        alive—<persName key="lili">Lili Elbe</persName>.</p>
                <p>So <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> found her. He sat down beside
                    her. Not a word was said. The next morning he came again, and his voice was
                    softer than usual. His rather stern face beamed with benevolence. He held her
                    hands and spoke many hopeful words to her. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    knew that in a few hours he would depart, and be away for several weeks. She
                    pulled herself together and tried to thank him for all he had been to her. But
                    she could not utter a word. When he had gone she felt utterly lost. Only one
                    thing gave her consolation: that she was allowed to remain in this asylum which
                    he had given her, and that she might here await his return.</p>
                <p>He was leaving for the South.</p>
                <p>A few days later everything had become lonely and empty. Easter was over and
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was saying good-bye. She was
                    obliged to return to <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> for some time. It
                    was a Monday morning. The car which was to take <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> to <placeName>the station</placeName> stopped <pb n="215"/>

                        key="womensClinic">the hospital</placeName>. <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> went with her to the vehicle. It was the first time that
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> had ventured into the world without,
                    beyond the park
                    wall.<!--not tagging this, since it's just an adjective and clear in context-->
                    When <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> returned alone through <placeName>the
                        park</placeName>, it was some time before she realized whither she was

                    since that day! <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> mentioned this in every
                    letter she wrote. They were mostly cheerful letters, breathing serenity and the
                    blitheness of spring. And the letters which <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    received from <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName> brought none but joyous
                    news and many cordial wishes. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> often
                    conveyed greetings from <persName key="rossiniEl">Elena</persName> and <persName
                        key="rossiniEr">Ernesto</persName>. From <persName key="lejeuneClaude"
                        >Claude</persName> came treasured words. Hardly a day passed without
                    bringing a message from friends to <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. And
                    hardly a day passed but that <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> wrote gay,
                    confident words to her friends. Days and weeks went by quietly, without
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> asking a question.</p>
                <p>All her burdens seemed to have slipped away. If she could only stay here always!
                    Never go away from here! That was her daily prayer. And so she forgot her fear.
                    She felt invulnerable against all adversity. She was like a piece of ground that
                    was cleared for the first time. And when of a night, at first shyly and then
                    with increasing confidence, she contemplated her body, she experienced a sweet
                    secret joy. For she saw all her members <pb n="217"/>

                    after miracle was working in her. And in these nocturnal hours, quite alone with
                    herself and her joy, she could stand in front of the mirror and gaze at the
                    picture of her young woman's body. It gleamed back at her immaculate from the
                    silvery sheen of the mirror. Yet she dared not confide in any creature upon
                    earth the happiness which she felt in these silent hours. Not even in her

                    smiled. So it began. And then we started chatting. It transpired that she is
                    half a Dane, her mother coming from <placeName key="denmark"
                    >Denmark</placeName>. She said: 'I guessed at once that you are a Dane, from
                    your long slender legs, just like mine. They are the Northern speciality. I
                    inherited my legs from my mother.' And then she proudly showed me 'her Northern
                    speciality'. How glad I am to have once more a person with whom I can converse!
                    The nurses have nick-named her <persName key="mrsTeddybear">Mrs.

                    wears in <placeName>the garden</placeName>. Then she said: 'I think we have the
                    same figure. We could certainly wear the same clothes and shoes.' I think so
                    too. Unfortunately she is not yet allowed to go for a walk, otherwise we should
                    have gone into <placeName>the town</placeName> together. She has to undergo an

                    room a portrait of her husband. I believe she is very sad. The poor thing! She
                    is scarcely twenty years old. Suddenly she asked after—my husband! I had to pull
                    myself together, for I must not betray myself. And so I merely hinted that
                    matters were much worse with me, so bad that I could not speak about them. Then

                    understood quite well that I ought not to bother myself about the matter.
                    Sometimes I think that he is treating me in such a way as to obliterate every

                    Since five o'clock this morning I have lain awake. I made a careful toilet, and

                    to the 'Magic Flute'. While I was looking in the mirror, and raising my arm as
                    if dancing, it suddenly struck me that this silk night-dress was more
                    appropriate for a bridal night than for an operation. Quickly I slipped it off,
                    and put on a quite simple gown.</p>

                        Professor</persName>. 'Here one learns to wait,' she had then said to
                        <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>. 'Yes, that is the first
                    thing <hi rend="italics">I</hi> teach young ladies,' <persName>the
                        friend</persName> answered, quick as lightning. And then they both declared
                    with one voice that it was really ludicrous to be afraid of <persName
                        key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>, that my respect for him was too
                    comical for words. He was the most amiable man; but a modern woman who was
                    afraid of one man was a ridiculous creature. They had scarcely finished chaffing
                    me before the door opened and <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>
                    was standing in the room. And both my modern champions of the sex withdrew
                    blushingly and almost panic-stricken. Not until long after <persName
                        key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> had evacuated the field did they
                    venture to put in an appearance. <persName key="mrsTeddybear"
                        >Teddybearkins</persName> was then very dejected. But <persName>the learned
                        madam of the medical faculty</persName><!--key unknown--> again rode the
                    high horse. 'That's the way to subjugate <pb n="241"/>

                    you not remain?' I asked with curiosity. 'I could not leave my poor little
                    friend in the lurch!' For the first time I laughed heartily again. It really
                    hurt me to do so. And <persName key="mrsTeddybear">Teddybearkins</persName> wore
                    a very guilty expression.</p>

                        key="nurseMargaret">Sister Margaret</persName>, who was carrying a tray with

                    happened so quickly that I had scarcely time to think about it. In a few minutes
                    everything was settled. I began to whimper with joy, like a foolish little girl.
                    'Does it still hurt?' asked <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>.
                    'No, no—on the contrary.' Then he had to smile. 'If everything functions
                    normally, you will have an injection,' he said shortly, and departed.</p>

                <p>Once more <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was lying in her chaise-longue
                    outside in <placeName>the park</placeName>. It was now summer. Bees flew humming
                    from flower to flower, and the birds were singing in the trees. The silver
                    birches were now clad in their richest foliage, and when the wind rustled
                    through them it seemed to <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> as though little
                    bells tinkled.</p>
                <p>Then someone called her name: "<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>!" And the
                    next moment she was enfolded in <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s
                    arms.</p>
                <p>Then followed days full of happiness and security. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> came each morning early and watched over every step which
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> now began to take timidly upon the
                    summery paths of <placeName>the park</placeName>. And <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> grew visibly better with every day that passed. Soon she
                    could stroll through <placeName>the park</placeName> again, free from all pain
                    and all fatigue. Then, arm in arm, like two affectionate sisters, the pair went
                    on voyages of exploration into the town.</p>
                <p>One evening, as she was entering <placeName>the park</placeName> with <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, <persName key="kreutz">the
                        Professor</persName> met her.</p>
                <p>"I am quite well now, <persName key="kreutz">Professor</persName>. But . . ." She
                    hesitated.</p>
                <p>"Well?"</p>
                <p>"Could I not stay here a few months longer with you, in case you should want to
                    operate upon me again?"</p>

                <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                <pb style="page" n="215"/>
                <p>He looked at her with a smile and shook his head. "No; it is high time for you to
                    go out into the world and try your wings."</p>
                <p>The same evening <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> found a bird's nest. It was
                    built under the roof of the covered passage which led from <persName
                        key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>'s private quarters to <placeName
                        key="womensClinic">the clinic</placeName>. A small family of sparrows. The
                    father sparrow and the mother sparrow were twittering and the young sparrows
                    were chirping. Perhaps a little family quarrel, thought <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>. Suddenly a young one fell out of the nest and remained
                    lying help less on the path. It fluttered its embryo wings and tried to fly, but
                    in vain. The wings were not strong enough to bear it. And the parents came
                    hurrying out of the nest on to the path and hovered about their young one. Their
                    twittering sounded a note of real terror. They could not get the youngster back
                    into the nest. Then <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> stooped down, took the
                    little bird in her hand, stroked it carefully, and felt the little heart beating
                    against her hand. Suddenly <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> was
                    standing beside her.</p>
                <p>"But why are you weeping, <persName key="lili">Frau Lili</persName>?" </p>
                <p>Mutely <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> handed her the little bird. "It has
                    fallen out of the nest and cannot yet fly. And the parents cannot help it. It
                    makes me think of myself. I too cannot yet . . ."</p>
                <p>She gave <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> the bird, and <persName
                        key="matron">the Matron</persName> fetched a ladder and laid the bird again
                    in the nest among its parents and brothers and sisters.</p>

                <p style="return"/>
                <p>The day of departure from <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName> passed off
                    much more quietly than <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had
                    anticipated. When <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> came to bid
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> farewell, <pb n="245"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="216"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> she said to him simply and calmly: "I owe you,
                        <persName key="kreutz">Professor</persName>, not only my life, but also hope
                    for the future, and all the confidence which I am now feeling. I will now try to
                    plunge into the world outside—but if I am in need, may I come back?"</p>
                <p><persName key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> only pressed her hand. "Write and
                    tell me where you are, how you are getting on, and what you are doing. And
                    regularly. Tell me everything. And if you want my help, you will always find a
                    refuge and friends here."</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> bade farewell to <persName key="matron">the
                        Matron</persName> and the other nurses. When they left the porch and she saw
                    her luggage piled high on the car, she thought with relief how simply and
                    naturally everything was now arranging itself, and how unpathetic and undramatic
                    life was when seen in daylight. The day before, and also the whole night, she
                    had been full of apprehension at this approaching moment of farewell; full of
                    fear and apprehension of life outside <placeName key="womensClinic">the
                        sheltered clinic</placeName>. Now, in the twinkling of an eye, she was
                    sitting in the train with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> on the
                    journey to <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>.</p>
                <p>And only many, many months later did she realize what a harsh transition from the
                    peace of <placeName key="womensClinic">the Women's Clinic</placeName> to the
                    outside world was the sojourn in <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>. She
                    understood subsequently why she had been sent out of <placeName key="dresden"
                        >her paradise on <placeName key="elbeRiver">the Elbe</placeName></placeName>
                    into the noisiest of all cities that she had ever seen. For these <placeName
                        key="berlin">Berlin</placeName> days were intended to give her an
                    opportunity to test herself, to prove her vitality and her capacity for living.
                    She stayed in a hotel, quite close to <placeName key="gebhardSanatorium">the
                        clinic</placeName> in which she, as a man, had been lying a few months
                    before. She felt no curiosity to revisit this place of transition, <pb n="246"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="217"/> as she subsequently called it. Nor had she any desire
                    to visit the friends of that time. To move, to live, to gaze and wander unknown
                    and anonymous among the millions of <placeName key="berlin">the giant
                        city</placeName>, to grow accustomed to the workaday rhythm of others, so
                    that she could one day share in this rhythm herself—such was the deepest meaning
                    of this <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName> sojourn.</p>
                <p>She was not always accompanied by <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> on
                    her strolls through <placeName key="tiergarten">the Tiergarten</placeName>,
                    through the museums and through the noisiest and most animated streets. She
                    often wanted to be alone, thrown quite back on her own resources, in order to
                    find her feet in the whirlpool of <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>.
                    For that was it—she must find her own feet, in order to demonstrate to herself
                    that she would be able to go her own way when left to herself. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> let her have her way. She was secretly glad
                    at <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s participation in the great and little
                    things of the day, although she certainly suspected that <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> was having the hardest possible struggle with herself
                    during these <placeName key="berlin">Berlin</placeName> days.</p>
                <p>So it was. There were days through which <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    dragged a tortured and lacerated heart, days when she was oppressed by numerous
                    fears. It is so easy, she would then think, to bear one's anonymous fate here
                    among utter strangers; but how would everything shape as soon as this anonymity
                    ceased, as soon as she was obliged to appear in those circles whence <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> has vanished, to which <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had belonged? She thought of her family in
                        <placeName key="denmark">Denmark</placeName>. Supposing she never returned
                    there? Would that not be the simplest? Would it not be better for her, the new
                    creature without a past and thus without <pb n="247"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="218"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> a family, to renounce everything connected with
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>? To renounce her friends and
                    relations in <placeName key="denmark">Denmark</placeName>? To renounce even the
                    friends in <placeName key="paris">Paris</placeName>, in order to start a new
                    life right from the beginning?</p>
                <p>She surrendered herself to such thoughts with fanaticism, with an obstinacy that
                    eventually suggested to her the question as to whether she ought not to part
                    from <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> for ever, secretly, slipping
                    away without a word? Or ought she to speak to <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>, to tell her in quiet, simple words that their ways must
                    now part? But hardly had she addressed this question to herself than she shrank
                    from the probe. Life and the world about her, everything would become empty and
                    cold if she should renounce everything that once surrounded <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. Would it not even be cowardice, the
                    confession of a guilty feeling, if she should break all the ties with the
                    past—with the past of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>? Would not
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> become lonely if she should part
                    from her for ever?</p>
                <p>These days of futile questionings were followed by nights when <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> lay sleepless and pondered upon everything that
                    had happened to her—to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>—to <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. And the more intimately, the more
                    longingly, the more ardently she let her thoughts wander through the corridors
                    of the past, the more terrified she became. For she perceived that her whole
                    mental life had been really obliterated from the day when she had been newly
                    created in <placeName key="dresden">the city by <placeName key="elbeRiver">the
                            Elbe</placeName></placeName>.</p>
                <p>A horror came upon her when she saw her questions confronting her without answer,
                    as if before a mist—a mist which became thicker and thicker <pb n="248"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="219"/> and eventually extinguished everything which had
                    formerly been. Faces which <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had known
                    faded away. A desert surrounded her, an empty waste wherein not even phantoms
                    emerged from the past.</p>
                <p>During such nights she felt close to madness; she dared not confide all that she
                    went through at this time to another person, not even to <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. Only two names grew clearer and clearer in
                    her present anguish. And to the names were attached two faces, one of which
                    belonged to <persName key="lejeuneClaude">Claude</persName>, and the other to
                        <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>, the young Italian officer,
                    who, an age ago, as she thought now, although it was really no more than a year,
                    had been with them together in <placeName key="rome">Rome</placeName>. <persName
                        key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>, with whom <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> felt some secret tie, as if instinctively imploring the
                    protection of a man, without being conscious of it in her own mind and without
                    even mentioning his name during these latter weeks. And the more ardently
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> conjured up in her heart the picture of
                        <persName key="feruzziRi">the Italian friend</persName>, the more distinctly
                    she felt his features mingling with the picture of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>All of a sudden it dawned upon her what a profound and strange secret was bound
                    up with the vow which, on a far-off evening in <placeName key="rome"
                        >Rome</placeName>, when <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>,
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, and <persName key="feruzziRi"
                        >Feruzzi</persName> were sitting together, <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> himself had taken: that <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> and <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName> should be
                    united because they belonged to each other, and that <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> should disappear.</p>
                <p>One night <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> suddenly woke up, stole softly to
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>, and took her hand.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was sleeping. She awoke in a fright
                    and saw <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> beside her.</p>
                <p>"Have I awakened you?" asked <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>.</p>

                <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                <p>"Oh, I was having such a beautiful dream!" said <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Where were you in your dreams?" asked <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> answered: "I think we were in
                        <placeName key="rome">Rome</placeName>."</p>
                <p>"And <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName> was with you, wasn't he?" asked
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. Then <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> put her arm round <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> and
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> her arm round <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName>. And neither spoke another word.</p>
                <p>The next morning <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> wrote a short and calm note
                    to <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>:</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c16l01ah">"Dear Friend,</p>

                    about it. Write her and do not neglect her."</p>
                <p>Underneath she signed her name, "<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>."</p>
                <p>After about a week she returned to <placeName key="dresden"
                    >Dresden</placeName>—to <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s home. And again
                    they went like two sisters through <placeName>the park of <placeName
                            key="womensClinic">the Women's Clinic</placeName></placeName>, and
                        <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName> rejoiced in them. Again they
                    said farewell, and, at his behest, proceeded to <placeName>a quiet woodland
                        village in <placeName key="erzgebirge">the
                        Erzgebirge</placeName></placeName>, stayed in a little hotel, lived in the
                    society of other people who were strangers, and, like them, seeking a few weeks'
                    convalescence. One day a letter came from <placeName key="italy"
                        >Italy</placeName> for <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>. <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> gave the letter to <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> to read. <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName> wrote
                    to say that he was at the service of both of them, wherever they were and
                    wherever he was, and that if they called he would come, and that his heart
                    belonged to them both. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> felt this day for

                        >Grete</persName> and that she had bestowed some happiness upon two other
                    persons. And then <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> learned what vow
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had sworn in <placeName

                <p>On this day <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> said: "Now I have made such

                <!-- RJP:2018-02-03: Nightmare sequence - on train -->
                <p>In the sleeping-car bound for <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName>—<persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was lying
                    in slumber most peaceful and profound—<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    suddenly awoke from a terrible nightmare. She did not know what she had dreamed,
                    but it seemed to her as if she had been on the point of suffocation. Cautiously
                    she opened the window. The ferry was in the midst of the sea. It was a grey,
                    starless August night. And as she stared out, she saw a picture in her mind's
                    eye. <placeName>The chief railway station of <placeName key="copenhagen"
                            >Copenhagen</placeName></placeName> full of people, and all crying out,
                        "<persName key="lili">Lili Elbe</persName>!" and pointing at her. And a
                    nameless horror gripped her. She could endure the sleeping-compartment no
                    longer. She dressed, and in the semi-darkness found her fur cloak, which had
                    been given her ages ago, in the early spring, in <placeName key="berlin"
                        >Berlin</placeName>. She stole out of the car, and crept along the feebly
                    illuminated gangway, up the damp steps of the ferry, and on deck. Not a person
                    was to be seen; everybody was asleep. The only sound that could be heard was the
                    churning up of the water by the propeller. The mast lights were burning dim. The
                    funnels of the steamer were spurting black smoke. From the refreshment-rooms of
                    the ship came the reflection of electric light. A few passengers were sitting
                    there. She leaned over for fear of meeting familiar faces, of being recognized
                    by anybody here. Like one pursued <pb n="252"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="223"/> she crept out of the beam of light into a dark
                    comer.</p>
                <p>She shivered. "No, no," she moaned, "I cannot go to <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName>." And the vision she had seen in the sleeping-car
                    below would not leave her. Her imagination painted the picture in colours ever
                    more vivid, and eventually she kept hearing out of the rhythm of the pounding
                    ship's engines the cry: "There she is! There she is! There she is! . . ."</p>
                <p>Suddenly she heard footsteps. She dared not look up. She crouched closer in her
                    corner. Like a black shadow she saw a man come striding by. His footsteps echoed
                    right across the deck, died away, and then came closer, and then quite near. The
                    man stopped just in front of her refuge, and struck a match in order to light a
                    cigarette. The flare of the match cast a lurid light over the man's face.
                    Involuntarily <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> had peered into the flame.
                    She pressed both her hands before her mouth so as not to cry out. As if in a
                    fever the thought throbbed in her: This man recognized you, and you know people.
                    She shut her eyes; she seemed to be imploring the grey heavens above: "Let me
                    die." And now it was this shriek of anguish which accompanied the rhythm of the
                    engine like a perpetual cry: "Let me die! Let me die! Let me die! . . .<!--Missing endquote in original--><choice>

                    </choice></p>
                <p>When at last the man had vanished, and she was again standing quite alone at
                    daybreak under the grey sky—a metallic reflection of the rising sun percolating
                    through the dreary, leaden covering of cloud—this cry of anguish kept forming
                    itself on her lips: "Let me die!" And, tired out, she dragged herself to the
                    railing, so utterly tired that she could <pb n="253"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="224"/>

                    at the dark sea, glittering here and there, without hope, with unseeing eyes,
                    too weak to resort to flight—flight from home, from herself, from nameless
                    horror.</p>
                <p>Quietly she crept back into the sleeping-car. <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> was sleeping soundly and had noticed nothing. Nor would
                    she ever learn of the incident, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> vowed. She
                    undressed noiselessly, crept back into her bed, and shed helpless tears. When
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> awoke, <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> had exhausted herself with crying, and her face was rigid
                    as a mask. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had to help her dress. The
                    lights of <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> were already
                    twinkling. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> caressed her companion and
                    spoke words of consolation. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> listened mutely
                    and nodded, but could not get the nightmare picture out of her head:
                        <placeName>the railway station</placeName> with the thousand pointing
                    fingers: "There she is! There she is!"</p>
                <p>But nobody at <placeName>the vast railway station</placeName> called out her
                    name. Nor was anybody there to meet her. With her coat-collar turned up, and a
                    thick veil round her hat, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> made her entrance
                    into <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>. Helpless as a child,
                    she clung to <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> the short distance
                    across the platform and the flight of steps leading to the waiting-room. She
                    dared not look up; she trembled violently whenever she passed a group of people,
                    like a person who had committed a crime and thought she was being followed from
                    all sides. The waiting-room had only a few occupants, and they sat down in its
                    extreme corner. <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had directed a porter
                    to put their luggage in the cloakroom. Then <persName key="cousin">one of
                            <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s cousins</persName>

                    curious eyes of this semi-stranger—but <persName key="cousin">the
                        cousin</persName> greeted them very simply.</p>
                <p>Believing that <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> would proceed at once to <persName key="sister"
                            ><persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s married sister</persName>, who
                    lived in a suburb of <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>, he had
                    not booked rooms for them. Now, however, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    suddenly refused to go to <persName key="sister">her sister</persName>.
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had last seen her two years
                    before, and <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> had now neither the strength
                    nor the courage to meet <persName key="sister">the sister</persName> who was
                    only a year older than <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.</p>
                <p>"Very well," declared <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>; "then I will
                    see about an hotel," and went to the telephone. To every inquiry the same answer
                    was returned, We are full up—no room available! It was August, and <placeName
                        key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> was crowded with summer visitors.
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> lapsed into sheer despair. Eventually,
                    after a dozen refusals had been received, <placeName>an hotel</placeName> was
                    found which offered a little room on the top floor. A quarter of an hour later
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was sitting in this room. The whole day
                    she did not venture to go out, but in the evening, without asking <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName>, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>
                    notified <persName key="brotherChris"><persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s
                        brother-in-law</persName> of their arrival.</p>
                <p>He came at once to <placeName>the hotel</placeName> and wanted to take <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> with him.</p>
                <p>"Give me just a few days longer. I must get used to the idea of seeing <persName
                        key="sister">my sister</persName> again. I have not the strength yet; I
                    cannot see people—least of all <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>'
                    family," implored <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, and all urging was in
                    vain.</p>
                <p>"I am afraid," <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> kept stammering. "I am <pb

                    proscribed or pursued. I would rather die."</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> did not stir from <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>'s bed that first night in <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName>. It was an endless night, full of perplexity.
                    Nothing was left of the creature who had so confidently left <placeName
                        key="womensClinic">the Women's Clinic</placeName>. All sangfroid and all
                    hope had forsaken her. "I must go back to <placeName key="womensClinic">the
                        hospital</placeName>, where I belong. There is no one elsewhere who loves me
                    and takes me for what I am. I must go back to the white sisters and to the other
                    women in <placeName>the park</placeName>, for whom I am no different from
                    themselves—women who need help and are helped."</p>
                <p>But she was not yet allowed to return to <placeName key="dresden"
                        >Dresden</placeName>. She was not allowed to stay in the little room of

                        to—<persName key="sister"><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>'
                        sister</persName>.</p>

                <head>XVIII</head>
                <p>Many weeks later <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> recalled to herself her
                    first encounter with <persName key="sister"><persName key="sparreAn"
                            >Andreas</persName>' sister</persName> in <placeName>the quiet villa by
                            <placeName key="gentofter">the Gentofter Lake</placeName></placeName>.
                    She began to keep a diary, in order to render an account of her activities and
                    her new beginning of life. The first shocks of her week at <placeName
                        key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> were a thing of the past. She had
                    again found peace and even a certain gaiety. She had even had strength to read
                    through the notes which <persName key="hvideNiels"><persName key="sparreAn"
                            >Andreas</persName>' friend in <placeName key="berlin"
                            >Berlin</placeName></persName> had made rather less than six months
                    before, at the time when <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> related the
                    story of his life to his friend throughout a night. <persName key="nephew"
                            ><persName key="sister">Her sister</persName>'s son</persName>, a young
                    medical student, had encouraged her to start making her own notes. "You would
                    render a service," he said, "to yourself and many other people if you would now
                    record your thoughts and feelings, just at this time when you want to prepare
                    for serious creative work." Also <persName key="kreutz">the
                    Professor</persName>, her distant helper, had advised her to try to write down a
                    record of her life and experience.</p>
                <p><persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> was not living with her. She had taken
                    up quarters with acquaintances in the town, as nobody in <placeName
                        key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> was supposed for the present to know
                    of <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s presence or even to be aware of her
                    existence. Consequently, <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> told
                    everybody who asked after <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> that he
                    lay seriously ill in a German hospital . . . and she visited her <pb n="259"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="228"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> friends only now and then in secret. Nor would
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> have it otherwise. She hardly dared do
                    more herself than leave <placeName>the
                    garden</placeName><!--this is not the same garden that was tagged near the Clinic-->
                    in the evening, heavily veiled, with her <persName key="nephew"
                        >nephew</persName>, to take walks in the neighbourhood under his protection.
                    So far her sole occupation in <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>
                    had been to help <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to regain her
                    freedom. It was imperative to prevent the least rumour becoming public, and to
                    proceed with all possible discretion in the effort to dissolve <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>'s marriage with <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. It was a difficult undertaking, the outcome of which
                    was by no means certain: no law as yet existed which could be invoked to meet
                    such a fantastic case. For as one of the spouses, <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, no longer existed, how then could a marriage between a
                    husband who no longer existed and his wife be dissolved? And yet it was
                    precisely to this "normal divorce law" which both the lawyers instructed, and
                    the body of judges to whom the case was assigned for settlement appealed as the
                    sole juridical criterion. This law required that for the period of one year
                    prior to divorce a separation should be enforced, and after the expiration of
                    this year a further year must elapse before the marriage could be absolutely
                    dissolved. In this way <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> would lose two
                    further years. <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> could not endure this
                    thought. She would not have <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> swindled
                    out of two years of her life. And as it seemed that the lawyers could find no
                    other way out of the difficulty, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    contemplated the drastic step of liberating <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> from the burden of a marriage tie with one who in the eyes
                    of the law was a dead man by her own voluntary death. Then they were assisted by
                    a suggestion from  <persName>an eminent lawyer</persName> <pb n="260"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="229"/>that they
                    should address a petition to <persName key="king">the King</persName>, praying
                    him to declare invalid, by an act of grace, the marriage once contracted by
                        <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. The petition was delivered at the end of August, and by
                    the end of September <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> were summoned to appear personally at the
                    hearing. When <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> inquired whether
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> was strong enough to accompany her
                    thence, she declared, beaming with joy: "If I can give you your freedom with so
                    little sacrifice, do you believe that I would think of myself even for a
                    moment?" And this journey to <placeName>Court</placeName> was the first common
                    excursion which <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> undertook. Two ladies appeared before the judges.
                    None but their two lawyers were present. The hearing took place in strict
                    secrecy. The whole proceedings lasted barely half an hour. <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> shrank from describing them, even from recording them. Nor
                    did <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> ever refer to them. And a few
                    days later, on the 6th October, they were apprised of <persName key="king">the
                        King</persName>'s decree, which declared invalid the marriage concluded
                    between <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName>.</p>
                <p>Shortly before this <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> had left
                            <placeName><persName key="sister">her sister</persName>'s
                        villa</placeName> and found a retreat in a couple of attics in
                        <placeName>the house of an acquaintance</placeName>.</p>
                <p>They were, indeed, very modest attics, in which she led her quiet life as long as
                    she stayed in <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>—as long, as she
                    stayed in <placeName key="denmark">Denmark</placeName>, and where she found the
                    necessary composure to put into practice the suggestion made by <persName
                        key="nephew">the son of <persName key="sister"><persName key="sparreAn"

                <p>On the 10th October she began. The first incident she recorded was her meeting

                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p01">"When on the second day of my stay in
                        <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> I went out to see
                        <persName key="sister"><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>'
                        sister</persName>—<!--there is a double dash here, should check against HTML, but it also might be a printer error-->now
                    I know and feel that I may also call her <persName key="sister">my
                        sister</persName>—I entered a room which I did not know, but in which
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had often been before. When I
                    opened the door no one was in the room, and when I took the first step I saw my
                    reflection in a mirror on the wall: a big, elegant woman with smiling eyes, with
                    rouged lips, with fresh cheeks, was staring at me. I was satisfied with my
                    reflection. I knew that I had done everything to make myself as handsome as
                    possible. In my own justification. Who could reproach me for resorting to all
                    the beautifying arts to which every woman has a claim. If I should ever paint
                    myself, I would like to retain this moment on canvas. Scarcely had I regarded my
                    own person than I saw behind me another picture, enclosed by the same mirror. A
                    large fjord landscape bathed in sunlight with luxuriant vegetation on both
                    banks. My heart stopped beating. I turned round; I stared at the landscape in
                    the heavy gilt frame on the wall. It was a picture which the young <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had painted of <placeName>his
                        home</placeName>. I looked round the room to see if anybody was observing
                    me. I saw on all walls of the room pictures of landscapes, towns, streams. I
                    recognized them all as <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' pictures. I
                    saw all his travels before me. There was <placeName key="balgencie">the town in
                            <placeName key="franceSouth">Southern France</placeName> on <placeName

                        >Grete</persName> had spent many joyous summer months. And not only
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>! No, I, <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>, had also lived down there, like a prisoner escaped from

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>

                    There was <placeName key="seineBridges">the bridge over <placeName key="seine"
                            >the Seine</placeName></placeName> in <placeName key="paris"

                        >Andreas</persName> had stood on this bridge . . . had peered down at the
                    river and wrestled with thoughts of death. And pictures by <persName
                        key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> hung beside them. One of them showed me
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, enticed out of <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, in woman's clothes. I approached the
                    picture and could not help stroking it, while tears ran down my cheeks. And I
                    sat down on a chair in front of the table. A big album was lying there.
                    Involuntarily I opened it and turned over the pages. I found the pictures of a
                    fair boy with large blue eyes . . . pictures of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> when he was still a child, innocently happy with
                        <persName key="brotherPlur">his two brothers</persName> and <persName
                        key="sister">his sister</persName>.</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p02">"Then the door opened and a lady with dark
                    hair and blue eyes and trembling arms entered the room: <persName key="sister"
                            ><persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' sister</persName>. I rose
                    to my feet and stood in front of her. And my <persName key="sister"
                        >sister</persName> had to look up to me, for I was bigger than she. Then an
                    absurd recollection flashed through me: <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> and <persName key="sister">his sister</persName> had
                    been the same size. From <persName key="sister">my sister</persName>'s eyes I
                    saw that she was thinking the same thing, and did not know what to make of the
                    idea. I said to her: 'Good day . . . be kind to your sister <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>.'</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p03">"Perhaps I should have said something
                    altogether different. I might have said: 'Be kind to me and love me as you loved
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.' Perhaps I might have said
                    nothing at all. Or perhaps I might have only smiled and said to her: 'Do not be
                    surprised because I am bigger than our dead brother <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, for I wear ever so high heels. And don't take this
                    amiss, because <pb n="263"/>

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> I want to be as pretty and ladylike as all

                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p04">"Then we sat together on the sofa and in
                    front of us lying on the table was the album with the portraits of <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> as a child. For a long time we held hands.
                    And <persName key="sister">my sister</persName> was kind; she sought for words.
                    Her eyes looked at me, her lips said something. And I did not know whether it
                    was her lips or her eyes which spoke to me: 'Don't be angry with me if I cannot
                    yet properly call you by your name of <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> . . .
                    if I cannot yet arrange my ideas about you . . . if I only seek for <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> when I look at you, in your eyes, at your
                    mouth, at your hands, and at your forehead. For I loved <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' eyes and his forehead so much. I kissed his forehead so
                    often. You know that, or don't you know it? But <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> knew it. For I am only a year older than <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. And when <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> and I were quite small, he five and I six years old, I
                    was his little mother. There was never a prettier, sweeter brother than he. He
                    played with my dolls, he pushed my doll's pram. And I called him "<persName
                        key="sparreAn"
                        >Lilleman</persName>"—little
                    man. Once when I wrote down the name for <persName key="mother"
                        >Mother</persName> and <persName key="mother">Mother</persName> told me that
                    I had spelt "Lilleman" with only one "n"
                    instead of two, I said that my brudderkins <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> was only a "Lilleman" with one "n", for he was not a proper man at all.
                        <persName key="mother">Mother</persName> smiled, and you too smiled when you
                    heard it—no . . . not you . . . <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    smiled. He did not know, perhaps, why he laughed. And I did not know why I had
                    said that my <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was not a proper man at
                    all. And do you still <pb n="64"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="233"/> remember how we used to push our doll's pram in the
                    woods? <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was so fond of pushing the
                    little pram. But he was afraid that others would see him and chaff him about it.
                    And do you remember how I would then place my hands over <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' little white hands? And do you know why I
                    did that? <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> never knew why, but I can
                    tell you now. I did it only in order that if we were surprised by anybody, I
                    alone could continue pushing the pram, while <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> could quickly remove his hands from the handle, as if
                    nothing had happened.' And if <persName key="sister">my sister</persName> did
                    not say this with her lips, she said it with her eyes. But it was no doubt her
                    lips. I only nodded, and kept nodding. I did not weep. I took it quite calmly
                    that for many, many days long she was seeking in me with her large, troubled,
                    woman's eyes only the picture of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>,
                    her little brother, and, as I now believe, found it. Sometimes, in the first
                    days, when we conversed with each other frequently with very painful feelings
                    for many hours, she addressed me as <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.
                    I felt then as if I ought to die. Nor could I conceal this from her. And then I
                    would implore her to believe me that I was not <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' murderer, that if <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had not died, I should have had to go under with him,
                    and that if I was living now, I owed him every day of my life. Once I said that
                    I really had neither parents nor brothers and sisters, as I was born not up here
                    in the North, but down in <placeName key="germany">Germany</placeName>. And
                    perhaps if <persName key="mother">mother</persName> had bore me as a girl, she
                    would not have loved me so much as she loved <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. It was probably on this <pb n="265"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="234"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> day that <persName key="sister"
                        >my sister</persName> said to me that everything that had happened in
                        <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName> was an outrage against Nature;
                    had been a gamble with Fate; questioning whether <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> could not really have survived; or whether it would not
                    have been far better for <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> to have
                    borne his heavy fate and his tortured body to the bitter end. Then she showed me
                    all the works which she had collected of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, and I perceived that her whole home was really a museum
                    for <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, for all the walls of her room
                    were crowded with <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' pictures. 'Don't
                    you see,' said <persName key="sister">my sister</persName>, 'what an artist we
                    have lost in him—how different he was from you?' 'Yes,' I said; 'that only goes
                    to prove how right <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was to release
                    me, for we were two beings, <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> and I. I
                    know that as a person I am far inferior to him, that I shall never be able to
                    achieve what he achieved, that I shall never be able to paint . . . that I don't
                    even want to paint. For if I did so I could never approach his standard. But
                    just because of this you can see that the beings who inhabited the body which
                        <persName key="mother">Mother</persName> bore were really two beings. I have
                    exchanged so much for this life which I must now live alone, as you yourself say
                    that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was so much stronger and more
                    capable than I. He lived and worked during a long life, and I dare hardly show
                    myself. And if I show myself, you all call me a joke, a deception, a masquerade.
                    Let us, I beg you, be friends and good sisters for the sake of our dead brother
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>.' </p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p05">"Then there was the day on which she said:
                        '<persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, perhaps no wrong has been done. It
                    was <pb n="266"/>

                    <pb style="page" n="235"/> certainly the will of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> that everything should happen as it ought to happen. He
                    was always chivalrous. And hence he released you, and withdrew his life for
                    yours.'</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d01p06">"It was a terribly hard contest between
                        <persName key="sister">my sister</persName> and me for my recognition as a
                    person, as a sister. And I know how unspeakably hard she found it to believe in
                    me as her sister <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> and to receive me, though
                    it were only out of compassion. I did not make it easy for her, for whenever I
                    showed myself, by my character and by the way in which I spoke, in which I
                    moved, in which I thought, I veiled completely the character of <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. He was ingenious, sagacious, and
                    interested in everything—a reflective and thoughtful man. And I was quite
                    superficial. Deliberately so. For I had to demonstrate every day that I was a
                    different creature from him, that I was a woman. A thoughtless, flighty, very
                    superficially minded woman, fond of dress and fond of enjoyment, yes, I believe
                    even childish. And I can say it calmly now: all this was certainly not merely
                    farcical acting. It was really my character, untroubled, carefree, illogical,
                    capricious.</p>

                    alone in my bedroom, I would look tired, done up, and impossible. And I felt
                    that everybody in <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>, even my
                    family, regarded me as a phenomenon. To be sure, people gradually got used to

                    They tried to persuade me that I need have no fear about my appearance, as I
                    looked like every other woman. Nevertheless, I was assailed by a deadly fear if
                    I left <placeName>the

                        son</persName> for a short walk. The tiniest smudge on the face intimidated
                    me at that time so much that I would only sally forth with him heavily veiled. I
                    felt like a pariah. Other women could be ugly, could commit every possible
                    crime. I, however, must be beautiful, must be immaculate, else I lost every
                    right to be a woman. Else I should have dishonoured him who had created me,

                    was so difficult to write to <persName key="kreutz">the Professor</persName>.
                    However much I wanted to, I could not bring myself to write him, as he would
                    only see in me a despondent, helpless, hopeless person."</p>

                    into contact with them, until <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> felt

                    was, as a woman, into cafés and restaurants. She went alone into shops to make
                    purchases, and eventually visited a hairdresser's. And when her friend <persName

                    all the more so as just at that time the whole secret of <persName

                    was divulged in <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> through the

                    published in unreserved fashion by an organ of the Press. <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> learned of this by accident. All her gaiety vanished again.
                    For many days she would not stir out of her attic. She paid no heed to anything,
                    and could not understand why none of <persName key="sparreAn"
                    >Andreas</persName>' friends found their way to her. A little entry in her diary
                    tells of this:</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c18d02p01">"How is it possible that all <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' friends here have left me in the lurch?
                    That they all avoid me as if I were a pariah? What have I done to them?
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> was always ready to help them.
                    He was always a reliable friend. And now one of them says that just because he
                    esteemed <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> so highly he could never
                    recognize <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>. <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> would always stand between him and <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>. He would shudder at offering her his hand. This
                    sentiment is nothing but an eruption of overweening masculinity. And another
                    excuses himself with other subterfuges. One could not be seen walking with
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> in the streets without compromising
                    himself. <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> was too small to

                        >Lili</persName> went to him. She carried out this resolve as if in a dream.

                        >Andreas</persName> had passed the happiest days of his childhood. But
                    nearly all recollections of this had been extinguished in <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName>. Everything seemed new to her, as if she saw it for the
                    first time. Only now and then, in a particular light, prompted by a sound or a
                    scent, would a far-off memory be kindled in her, as if through a haze. But it
                    was never anything exact that stirred in her.</p>
                <p>One day <persName key="brotherSing">her brother</persName> went with her into the
                    town, to show her <placeName>the old parental house</placeName> in which
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had been born and nurtured and
                    their parents had lived until their death.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> stood in front of the old house of her
                    parents; she recognized it, remotely and hazily, like something of which one had
                    once dreamed. <persName key="brotherSing">Her brother</persName> frequently
                    asked her if she could not remember this or that incident from common childhood.
                        <persName key="brotherSing">The brother</persName> was only a few years
                    older than <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>. And it had always been
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> who had remembered all the
                    incidents of the past more clearly than anyone else. But <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili</persName> was always obliged to answer in the negative, however hard
                    she tried to conjure up pictures from <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' past. She always had such a strange feeling, as if
                    something were vibrating in the depths of her being. But she was still too weak
                    to form a precise idea of what it was. Frequently these questions tortured her,
                    and <persName key="brotherSing">her brother</persName> felt it and desisted.</p>
                <p>It was not through the past that she felt herself linked to <persName

                <p><persName key="brotherSing">Her brother</persName> regarded her with surprise. He
                    took her hands and drew her to him protectively.</p>

                <p>"Yes," she said, tormented by a secret fear, "I know I have had neither father
                    nor mother. I am really quite alone in the world, and often think that life is
                    too full of dangers to be able to master it alone. Just for me. You must
                    understand that. My life began amidst terrible pain, and sometimes I fear that
                    everything has been in vain. But then again it seems as if something great and
                    strong has sustained me. Then I feel something precious stirring within me. It

                        Norwegian veterinary surgeon</persName>, who, without knowing what had
                    happened to her, told her that he had been experimenting for a long time with
                    the transplantation and grafting of ovaries upon animals and explained how the
                    effect of these new ovaries was so great as to change completely the animal's
                    character and determined its age. And inasmuch as animals were less valuable
                    subjects than human beings, he had more opportunity as a veterinary surgeon to
                    study this phenomenon by experiments than other doctors. It went without saying
                    that similar processes would be observed in the case of human beings.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> now realized that the crisis through which

                    was a natural consequence of the implantation which had been carried out upon

                <p>She confided all this to her diary:</p>

                    was necessary above all else to recuperate. When this had happened to some
                    extent, the physical change in me began. My breasts formed, my hips changed and
                    became softer and rounder. And at the same time other forces began to stir in my
                    brain and to choke whatever remnants of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> still remained there. A new emotional life was arising
                    within me."</p>

                <pb style="page" n="244"/>
                <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/>
                <p>At that time she wrote a letter to <persName key="kreutz">Werner
                        Kreutz</persName>:</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c19l01p01">"I feel so changed that it seems as if you
                    had operated not upon my body, but upon my brain. And although my face still
                    bears traces of what I have gone through, I feel I am getting younger and
                    younger every day.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c19l01p02">"Even the name of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas Sparre</persName> has no longer a bitter sound for me. He first had
                    his youth, but now I believe that I am going to have mine. And sometimes I find
                    it is unjust for me to retain his age and birthday, for my biological age is
                    quite different from his. And it is also painful for me that his name instead of
                    my name is on the official records. <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>
                    and I have really nothing whatever to do with each other.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c19l01p03">"I have now been a few weeks in <placeName
                        key="vejle">his birthplace</placeName>, but I have felt like a stranger
                    there all the time. Nothing of what is now stirring in me was born in
                        <placeName>his parents' house</placeName>. I am newly created. I was born
                    under your auspices in <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName>, and my
                    birthday is that April day on which you operated upon me. My temperament, too,
                    is like April weather. I laugh and cry at the same time. My heart is full of
                    expectation as a spring day. And every time I feel stirring within me this new
                    life and this new youth, as if I were mother and child at the same time, then
                    all my thoughts turn towards you in boundless gratitude."</p>
                <p>A few days later <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> filled many pages in her

                    me when I speak of the question of my age. And a number of doctors have even
                    promised to help me if I should later attempt to cut loose from <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> in this respect, so that I am given an age
                    that corresponds to my physical development as a woman. Others may ridicule this
                    question or regard it with indifference; the important thing, in their view, is
                    that one feels young and gives a youthful impression. I, on the other hand,
                    believe just the contrary—that one is, in fact, actually as old as the official
                    papers state, whether one feels young or old. Yesterday I discussed this
                    question with <persName>a friend, who is a lawyer</persName>, and said to
                    him:</p>

                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c19d02p03">"And what did he say? He replied that I
                    must not be so immodest. I must take over <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' age as a heritage, just as I have inherited all his
                    rights. Which I vigorously contested. 'Assume, for the sake of argument,' I
                    said, 'that I have some talent for painting and now began to paint like him.

                    to the various exhibitions committees who knew him and there telling my
                    fantastic story to the best of my ability, in order to claim whatever rights
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had? Both the French and the

                        >Andreas</persName>. At least I should be regarded as an improbable
                    phenomenon and ridiculed accordingly.</p>

                    that one enters upon the heritage with all its assets and liabilities, and for
                    this reason one can even refuse to accept an inheritance. I lay no claim to

                    birthday, for his birthday signifies for me nothing but a liability. I cannot be

                    fear that just this very circumstance might be disastrous for my future. You

                    duties attaching to such position; but if a person has to begin right at the
                    beginning, then everybody asks, especially if the subject be a woman, how old
                    she is. And almost everywhere young people are preferred because it is thought
                    that the future is theirs and that they possess possibilities of development.

                        >Berlin</placeName> to <placeName key="dresden">Dresden</placeName>
                    everything had come back to her again, vividly illuminated by a remarkable light
                    which cast no shadows.</p>
                <p>It was a confession which she poured out without restraint and without mercy on
                    herself.</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c20d01p01">"I feel like a bridge-builder. But it is a
                    strange bridge that I am building, I stand on one of the banks, which is the
                    present day. There I have driven in the first pile. And I must build it clear
                    across to the other bank, which often I cannot see at all and sometimes only
                    vaguely, and now and then in a dream. And then I often do not know whether the
                    other bank is the past or the future. Frequently the question plagues me: Have I
                    had only a past, or have I had no past at all? Or have I only a future without a

                    was dissipated, every doubt of my proper existence. He only saw the woman in me,
                    and when he thought of <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, or spoke to

                    secrecy was observed towards the newspapers as to the character of the
                    exhibition. To avoid gossip, it was given out that the main object of the
                    exhibition was to raise funds, through the sale of <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>' latest pictures, to defray the cost of his long illness
                    in a German hospital.</p>
                <p>Invitations were despatched to the opening of the exhibition.</p>
                <p>This exhibition was not calculated to excite surprise, as <persName

                        >Grete</persName> had exhibited in <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName> nearly every year, and, in fact, in <placeName>the

                <p>On this occasion a strange feeling of suppressed curiosity pervaded the
                    atmosphere on the opening day. The most intimate friends of the artist were, of
                    course, initiated into the secret. But many others, who also made their
                    appearance on this occasion, had heard of the rumours that had long been current
                    in <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>. And all these rumours,
                    however frequently they had been contradicted, cropped up again phantom-like.
                    Nobody ventured to buy a single picture.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName>'s resources melted away. She was depressed
                    at the thought that she might be compelled to accept assistance from her
                    relatives, however gladly they would have offered it to her. A suggestion was

                    completed; but she rejected this proposal with something like horror.</p>
                <p>An acquaintance then hit upon the absurd idea that <persName key="lili"

                <p>She had long been wanting to write a descriptive article dealing with <persName

                        >Lili</persName> had hitherto vetoed the suggestion. But now, <persName>the
                        friend</persName> explained, the time had arrived when the public ought to
                    learn the real truth. Such a well-known artist as <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> simply could not just disappear. Consequently, it was
                    only natural that the most fantastic rumours should be circulating in <placeName
                        key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>, especially as <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> had so mysteriously disappeared from
                    existence for nearly a year. And now she was resolved to relate in her newspaper
                    the manner in which <persName key="kreutz">a gifted German surgeon</persName>
                    had transformed the mortally ill <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas
                        Sparre</persName> into a glowing young woman, into <persName key="lili">Lili
                        Elbe</persName>. The achievement of <persName key="kreutz">the German
                        surgeon</persName> must be broadcasted to the world. It must not be allowed
                    to remain a secret. It must be divulged one day, and now was the appropriate
                    time.</p>
                <p>With a heavy heart, persuaded by <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> and
                    all her friends, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> at length consented.</p>
                <p>The next day, the beginning of March 1931, the article appeared and cleared the

                    the world press. Everywhere in <placeName key="europe">Europe</placeName> and
                        <placeName key="america">America</placeName> this extraordinary human fate
                    was discussed. But despite the fact that <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    had now become a world celebrity, and the newspapers in all languages
                    broadcasted her portrait everywhere, she went about <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName> more peaceably than ever. Her constant fear, that
                    people would shout her name after her in the street, did not materialize.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the few who knew her, no one imagined for an instant that
                    the young lady who strolled almost daily along <placeName key="stroget">the
                        "Strög"</placeName>, and differed in no respect from other ladies, was the
                    legendary <persName key="lili">Lili Elbe</persName>. A few days after the
                    publication of the first article about her, she happened to be standing among a
                    group of people in front of the entrance of a publishing house, where an
                    illustrated article about her had just appeared in a weekly magazine, in order
                    to buy a copy of this periodical. Then she sat down in a tram and read her own
                    story just like many of the others who were sitting in the car. Nobody took any
                    notice of her, although she was wearing the same coat and the same hat as in the
                    photographs which illustrated the article.</p>
                <p>After this "success" she was quite reassured and henceforth had various amusing
                    experiences.</p>
                <p>She went daily to <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' exhibition, which
                    was now thronged by people who hoped to catch a glimpse of <persName key="lili"
                        >Lili Elbe</persName>. And nearly all the pictures were sold, without a
                    single one of the visitors having recognized her.</p>
                <p>Once an old lady even came up to her and whispered: "Tell me, miss, don't you

                <p>"Yes," answered <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, "most decidedly that is

                    a Swedish lady entered and exclaimed:</p>

                    herself received many proofs of sympathy, especially from women. Women whom she
                    did not know in the least sent her letters full of comprehension and enthusiasm.
                    Flowers were sent her by unknown admirers. Various doctors offered to attend her
                    without payment so long as she remained in <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName> and to supervise her state of health.</p>

                <p>During these short weeks which she spent with <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> in <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>,
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> knew for the first time what it was
                    like to be in the company of a happy woman who was in love.</p>
                <p>And now, when <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> had left her alone,
                        <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> felt a secret sorrow, a restrained
                    grief, almost a feeling of envy—but no, it could not be envy, for she knew that
                    no one more deeply wished <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> to be happy
                    than she.</p>
                <p>At length it dawned upon her that what was affecting her so painfully was a void
                    in her life, something unfulfilled that in all probability never could be
                    fulfilled.</p>
                <p>All this she felt vaguely, and yet she feared to give a name to this new thing
                    that was stirring within her.</p>
                <p>Spring was now advancing. <placeName>The garden of the house in which her attic
                        was situated</placeName> was quivering with tender green: <persName
                        key="lili">Lili</persName> felt her body thriving. But she also felt how
                    this mysterious craving within her for something to which she could give no name
                    became ever more clamant and insistent.</p>
                <p>She began to work more and more strenuously, as if she had no time to lose. All
                    through the night she would fill pages as she wrote down her confessions. She
                    allowed herself only a few hours' <pb n="292"/>

                    play for hours. Then she would sit sewing new clothes, or lend a hand with the
                    work of the house. Her evenings she spent with relatives and friends. She often
                    visited <persName key="germanFriend">her German friend</persName>, taking to him
                    fresh sheets of her manuscript, although she felt increasingly reluctant to
                    discuss with him what she had written.</p>
                <p>"Put it all in order," she would often say, "and do not read it until I have left
                        <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName>."</p>
                <p>She had arranged with <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> that when the
                    summer came she would join her and <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>

                    thing is the completely naked and the brutal. But all truth, in fact, is brutal.
                    Much of it is even shameless, and there are very few people who can understand

                    That is the remarkable thing about your fate, the unique thing that slumbers
                    within you, namely, the emotional bond between the two sexes. This presentiment

                    pulsated through the heart of a man, rises now and again through the mists of
                    ambiguity into a penetrating insight. And you have transferred this intuition to
                    the pages of your confession in a scrappy sort of way and perhaps expressed it
                    in inadequate and tentative words. And frequently your words only hint at the
                    thing, frequently you are silent, probably out of suppressed shame. This new
                    country, <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>, this new country of the soul, is

                    don't forget they are a newly married pair. Have happy people, who have

                        >Claude</persName>.' And I still heard my words ringing in my ear. They were
                    uttered without agitation, as softly as a schoolgirl speaks.</p>
                <p style="LiliDiary" xml:id="a1c22d01p23">"And consequently I did not even remark

                    took both my hands and kissed them. Only when <persName key="lejeuneClaude"

                    realize what he and I had said, and an unaccountable feeling flooded me,
                    something which I had never perceived before, something blissful, yet
                    frightening.</p>

                    a portrait of herself. I was standing behind her, but it was hardly necessary
                    for me to tell her how to paint. I told her about myself and <placeName

                    which moved me and which my little pupil perhaps did not really understand. We
                    are very happy together. I saw that I could give her a good deal of useful
                    advice. After she had gone, leaving the picture she had begun standing on the
                    easel which I had inherited from—<persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>, I
                    searched among the many pictures which were still left over from <persName

                    little pupil off the easel, and placed the empty canvas on it. And suddenly I
                    took a brush myself and began to paint. What I wanted to paint I did not know.
                    And I painted and painted.</p>

                <p>Frequently her heart beat so violently that she had to clutch her breast, and a

                <p>Then she sank back into a semi-conscious state of dreaming, in which she had lain

                        <placeName key="anhalterStation">the Berlin station</placeName>.</p>
                <p>She had deliberately taken the same train as on the occasion, more than a year

                <p>She had closed her eyes and tried to collect her thoughts. The year that had
                    passed wandered through her memory like a hurried, endless pilgrimage, this

                    the edge of a precipice and yet always accompanied in a mysterious way by
                    guardian angels. And she thought of <persName key="kreutz">her
                    helper</persName>, and whether he would be satisfied with her. Was she worthy of
                    all he had done for her? Not until this moment did it dawn upon her that she had
                    been placed at a post which she was not allowed to leave. And she vowed to
                    herself that nothing which had been sown in her personality should lie fallow.
                    Everything in her should sprout and blossom and become fruit, in her life and in
                    her work, in her art, which, as she now knew, was only waiting to be quickened
                    into vigorous life.</p>
                <p>How she had fared up till now she had recorded in her diary. Her confessions were
                    almost completed. They were left behind in <placeName key="copenhagen"
                        >Copenhagen</placeName>, in the shape of a bundle of foolscap covered with
                    writing. One day her confessions—and she smiled at this thought—would burst upon
                    mankind as the confessions of the first person who was not born unconsciously
                    through a mother's travail, but fully conscious through her own pangs.</p>
                <p>She wanted to be a bridge-builder.</p>
                <p>She recalled the phrase of <persName key="germanFriend">her German
                        friend</persName> in <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> and
                    thought that she had perhaps built a slender bridge across that abyss which
                    separates man and woman.</p>
                <p>Like a far-off dream she saw in her mind's eye <placeName>the <placeName
                            key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> railway station</placeName>, all
                    the companions and friends of those vanished days and weeks and months she had
                    passed in the northern capital.</p>
                <p>She also saw among them the little schoolgirl <pb n="304"/>

                    <persName key="ruth">Ruth</persName>, who had been her pupil. She had taught in
                    order to learn that she too could henceforth paint, and that she was now strong
                    enough to claim that immortal heritage which <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> had bequeathed to her.</p>
                <p>And she smiled again when she thought of the dark girlish head of her pupil
                        <persName key="ruth">Ruth</persName> etched against the bright background,
                    where the palms of the South<!--don't tag, this is description of a painting-->
                    were waving in a blue spring sky; and these palms and this sky were nothing but
                    a corner of a picture which she possessed from <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, her dead brother, and which he had discovered during
                    his last Italian summer, spent in the company of <persName key="sparreGre"
                        >Grete</persName> and <persName key="feruzziRi">Feruzzi</persName>.</p>
                <p>"<persName key="ruth">Ruth</persName>," she had then said to her pupil, "I owe it
                    to <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> that I am now able to guide your
                    first steps into your art. So for your first picture you should borrow something
                    from what was perhaps <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' last

                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> closed her eyes and continued to smile.</p>
                <p>Then the train slowed down. She opened her eyes and looked out of the window:
                        <placeName key="neustadt">Neustadt</placeName>! Was it possible?</p>
                <p>In feverish haste she put on her hat and coat. Slowly the train moved again, and
                    was now crossing <placeName>the great bridge over <placeName key="elbeRiver">the
                            Elbe</placeName></placeName>. Suddenly <placeName key="dresden"
                        >Dresden</placeName> burst on her vision, her beautiful and beloved city of
                        <placeName key="elbeRiver">the Elbe</placeName>. Domes and towers were
                    reflected in the wide river, her river.</p>
                <p>Trembling violently she glued herself to the carriage window. She clenched her
                    teeth in a frenzied effort to keep back the tears. No, she must not weep
                    now.</p>
                <p>A few minutes later she was sitting in a car <pb n="305"/>
                    <pb style="page" n="272"/>
                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> which took her to <placeName key="womensClinic"
                        >the Women's Clinic</placeName>. Chastened but cheerful she entered the
                    portal of the home of her heart. Suddenly she hesitated, looked around her, and
                    for the first time a doubt assailed her. "Why have I come here at all? And what
                    do I want to ask him?" Thus she stood irresolute in the grounds.</p>
                <p>The rain had ceased. The white birch trees lifted their light, bright crowns to
                    the pale, watery sky. A couple of white-clad nurses nodded a greeting. Young
                    doctors in professional attire strode through <placeName>the park</placeName>.
                    Pregnant women were strolling there: "Blue crocuses," she thought, with a
                    smile.</p>
                <p>She remained standing and regarded the young women. Now she knew why she had
                    come.</p>
                <p>A white-clad figure stood at the door which led to the private ward, and with a
                    cry of joy <persName key="lili">Lili</persName> threw herself into the motherly
                    arms of <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName>. One nurse after another
                    came up, and they all rejoiced at the reunion.</p>
                <p>Everything was unchanged.</p>
                <p><persName key="lili">Lili</persName> took <persName key="matron">the
                        Matron</persName>'s hand. "Come with me just once through the house. I want
                    to see all the corridors again."</p>
                <p>And <persName key="matron">the Matron</persName> took her through all the
                    corridors.</p>
                <p>When she was tired out, she sat down in one of the large easy chairs in the long
                    corridor through the great folding doors of which fell a beam of greenish light.
                    Perhaps she would have to wait a long time.</p>
                <p>She said the words to herself like a childish wish:</p>
                <p>"Wait a long time, wait a long time."</p>

                <pb style="page" n="273"/>
                <p>She drank in the smell of ether and formalin as if she were thirsty. And all the
                    familiar noises from the corridors and halls and rooms crowded in upon her.</p>
                <p>She waited. A blissful peace invaded her mind.</p>
                <p>The folding doors opened. A slender figure in a white overall, with dark hair
                    over the lofty brow, came towards her.</p>
                <p>Like a sleepwalker she let herself be led into <persName key="kreutz">the
                        Professor</persName>'s room.</p>
                <p>And she listened fascinated to the strange, muffled voice. She had quite
                    forgotten why she had come. She had forgotten everything she wanted to ask. She
                    could only say: "Yes, <persName key="kreutz">Professor</persName>."</p>
                <p>Suddenly <persName key="kreutz">Werner Kreutz</persName> looked at her
                    sharply.</p>
                <p>"What do you want to ask me? I can tell from your expression that you want
                    something. Tell me what it is. . . ." <persName key="lili">Lili</persName>
                    roused herself from her stupor. The secret anxiety which she could never banish
                    now gripped her, and, looking the while calmly into his eyes, she said:</p>
                <p>"Tell me, <persName key="kreutz">Professor</persName>, do you think that I am now
                    strong enough for another operation, for I want so much to become a mother."</p>

                        key="kreutz">Professor Kreutz</persName> decided to operate upon me again.
                    It will be the last time. Probably the operation will be performed on Tuesday,
                    but promise me that <persName key="sparreGre">Grete</persName> shall hear
                    nothing about it. It would cast a shadow over her happiness. She would be
                    worrying on my account, for which there is no need. I am so pleased to be here
                    in <placeName key="womensClinic">my Women's Clinic</placeName> again. <persName
                        key="kreutz">The Professor</persName> has promised to read my 'Confessions'
                    and to help me, should it be necessary, to correct them. He too is of opinion
                    that they ought to appear as a book.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l01p02">"For the rest I consider it splendid of him,
                    instead of resting on his laurels, to incur the risk of operating upon me once
                    more, so that I should be quite well and able to take a husband and perhaps also
                    to have children to make me happier still. <persName key="kreutz">My

                    is my moral duty to make my 'Confessions' public, in order to teach people not
                    to judge."</p>

                        key="dresden">Dresden</placeName>, which is my home, and you have read the
                    last word of my 'Confessions', 'I want so much to become a mother!' I feel
                    impelled to write you, <persName key="germanFriend">my friend and
                        father-confessor</persName>, at very great length. I shall perhaps be
                    somewhat prolix, but have patience with me. I have no time to lose. In two days
                    I shall be operated upon again.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p02">"You must sympathize with me in my desire for
                    maternity, to have a child, for I want nothing more ardently than to demonstrate
                    that <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> has been completely obliterated
                    in me—is dead. Through a child I should be able to convince myself in the most
                    unequivocal manner that I have been a woman from the very beginning.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p03">"Please understand me: the alienation from
                        <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> must inevitably crystallize into
                    the resolution to forget a person who, as <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, has been a tragic obstacle which prevented me from
                    experiencing all the mysteries and wonders which are part of the life of the
                    girl, the maid, and the woman, in the same way as all other members of my sex.
                    Because I lived a first life encased in a panser, from which I could not get
                    free, my youth as girl and maiden has been <pb n="309"/>

                    <pb style="heading" rend="MIW"/> stolen from me, has been suppressed. This also
                    explains why then I returned to <placeName key="denmark">Denmark</placeName>
                    from <placeName key="germany">Germany</placeName>. The atmosphere of <placeName
                        key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> felt most repellent. <placeName
                        key="denmark">Denmark</placeName> was the stage on which <persName
                        key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName> made his first appearance; it was his
                    home—for me, on the contrary, it was nothing less than a cast-off snake-skin.
                    Consequently, <placeName key="copenhagen">Copenhagen</placeName> was a very
                    difficult place for me to return to, because I had to fight not only for my
                    future, but against my past, which was really not my past at all, but the past
                    of an alien creature who had also robbed me of my home. <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>, therefore, appears to me to-day in the light of a
                    usurper. For the same reason I find it hard to endure the South and West of
                        <placeName key="europe">Europe</placeName>, because everything there is
                    bound up with <persName key="sparreAn">Andreas</persName>' past. On the other
                    hand, my love for <placeName key="germany">Germany</placeName>, for <placeName
                        key="berlin">Berlin</placeName>, and above all for <placeName key="dresden"
                        >Dresden</placeName>, is easy to understand; <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName> did not know these cities, these landscapes and the
                    atmosphere of <placeName key="germany">Germany</placeName>, his acquaintance
                    with them being of the most cursory character when he was in a dying condition.
                    What a boon for me it was to be here, where it is only present and future for
                    me, and where there is no past connected with <persName key="sparreAn"
                        >Andreas</persName>! Here I have merely to fight for my future from the
                    basis of the present, unburdened by the painful past of another person.</p>

                    people touched me on the sorest point of my sensibilities, without their knowing

                    effeminate expression all the pictures of that time reveal! How imploring and
                    helpless the glance! Then I looked in the mirror to see what I am like now. My
                    face has become smoother, and healthier, and fresher, the whole body more taut
                    and feminine. But my eyes have a self-conscious expression. I am not pleased at
                    this; life has hardened me.</p>
                <p style="letter" xml:id="a1c23l02p13">"Now I have returned once more. Here, where
                    the strong will of another stands between me and the outside world, as my
                    protector and defender, I can cast off the assumed sternness of my character. It
                    is not really sternness, but a very fragile shell around a completely

                    fêted<!--character appears in original--> artist on my own account. For I do not

                    I make myself clear? It is not with my brain, not with my eyes, not with my
                    hands that I want to be creative, but with my heart and with my blood. The
                    fervent longing in my woman's life is to become the mother of a child. Whether
                    this wish can be fulfilled or not, the fact that I can openly acknowledge this
                    desire from the fullness of a pure woman's heart is an infinite happiness for
                    me. The fact that I may experience this happiness justifies everything that has
