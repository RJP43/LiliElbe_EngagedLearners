<verse n="verse one"> 
Do you remember the 21st night of
September?
Love was changing the minds of
pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were
singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the
night away"</verse>

<chorus>
Hey hey hey
Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day
Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda</chorus>

<verse n="verse two"> 
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the true love we share today </verse two>

<chorus> 
Hey hey hey
Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day
There was a
Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, golden dreams were shinny days
The bell was ringing
Our souls were singing
Do you remember, never a cloudy day
There was a
Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day
There was a
Ba de ya, say do you remember

<verse = "verse two">
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation

She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation

I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies </verse>

<bridge> </bridge>
He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you" </bridge>

<chorus> 
It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had </chorus>

<verse = "verse two"> 
The wild <animal/> dogs </animal> cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company 

I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti </verse>

<bridge> 
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become </bridge>

<chorus> 
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had </chorus>

<outro> 
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you </outro>

<chorus> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do /** this shows dedication to the singer's love interest **/
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
(I bless the rain)
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
(Ah, gonna take the time)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had </chorus>
