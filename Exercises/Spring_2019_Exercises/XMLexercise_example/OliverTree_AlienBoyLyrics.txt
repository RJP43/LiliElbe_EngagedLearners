[Chorus]
I fell down to earth
From a hundred miles away and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out

[Verse 1]
Three doors down so you can't ignore it
I'll hunt you down like a tyrannosaurus
My teeth are sharp like the great white shark
Let me taste that flesh, it's my favourite part
Got an eagle beak, with the ostrich feet
7 spider eyes for every day of the week
Means I'm still up working while your bitch ass sleeps
I'm an alien among the human beings

[Chorus]
I fell down to earth
From a hundred miles away and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out

[Verse 2]
Ten doors down but you still can't see me
I talk a lot of shit so you won't believe me
I really wouldn't say anything else
I shouldn't be standing here all by myself
'Cause I'm out there
Tried to tell you that I'm out here on my own
I told you I was out there
Tried to tell you that I'm out here on my own

[Chorus]
I fell down to earth
From a hundred miles away and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out

[Bridge]
I won't be here long at all

[Chorus]
I fell down to earth
From a hundred miles away and somehow
I still make it work
But it's overrated and somehow played out
