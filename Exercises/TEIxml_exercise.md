# TEI XML Exercise  
  
Learners should consult our February 12th/14th lesson, [Schematizing XML: TEI and Project Constraints](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/wiki/Schematizing-XML:-TEI-and-Project-Constraints), while completing this exercise. For this exercise learners will be working in teams to analyze some of the Lili Elbe project's German and Danish encoded [archival materials](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/tree/master/ProjectDocs/archivalMaterials).   
  
## Logistics  
  
To begin, download both your specific team's XML and our project schema. Then associate our schema to your team's assigned XML. Instructions to download and associate are available under the section title "[How to Associate the Lili Elbe Digital Archive's (TEI-based) Schema](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/wiki/Schematizing-XML:-TEI-and-Project-Constraints#how-to-associate-the-lili-elbe-digital-archives-tei-based-schema)" of our [Schematizing XML: TEI and Project Constraints](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/wiki/Schematizing-XML:-TEI-and-Project-Constraints) lesson.   
  
Learners will answer the questions and information requests, under the "Requirements" section of this document, in the issue each team has been assigned to on [our class's issues board](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues). For example: if you were assigned German Letter 2 then your issue on the issues board is titled ["German Letter 2"](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues/9). In order to complete this assignment each learner of the team must equally contribute by responding on the specific issue they are assigned. We encourage teams to communicate primarily on their team's issue. Additionally, remember writing on the issues board means there is the ability to write in markdown. More information about writing on the issues board can be found [here](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/wiki/Working-in-GitHub#using-our-issues-board).         
   
There will not by anything each team needs to upload to SAKAI; however, **one member from each team will be required to re-upload the team's assigned XML file in order to prove the team has correctly associated the project schema**. Please follow the instructions under the heading "Adding an existing file directly on GitHub" of our [Working in GitHub wiki](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/wiki/Working-in-GitHub#uploading-directly-on-github); however, **please upload your XML in the same folder you downloaded the original XML from**. For example: if you were assigned German Letter 2 then you will upload your XML in the [German_letter2 folder](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/tree/master/ProjectDocs/archivalMaterials/German_archive/German_letter2) with the same name as the original XML - `German_letter2.xml`.    
  
## Requirements  
1.  Associate [the project schema](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/blob/master/WIKIandREADMEmaterials/MIWschema.rng) with your team's assigned XML document. Re-upload your team's assigned XML to your assigned document's folder in [the archival materials folder](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/tree/master/ProjectDocs/archivalMaterials) of our class repository. Review the schema-validated XML and report an explanation of any errors firing in the XML on your team's issue on [our class's issues board](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues). *Every XML included in the archival materials folder for this exercise will fire a schema validation error; therefore, if `<oXygen/>` does not turn red upon association then you have not correctly associated the project schema.*  
2.  Identify all of the unique places and people mentioned in your XML and list them on your team's issue on [our class's issues board](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues). Refer to our [spreadsheet of propography IDs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TGp-RpKQi7rLHhdZTs4Vr6Ft91kPipfBwQR_7ii9bng/edit?usp=sharing) to verify each person and place has been given the correct key attribute value and report on your team's issue the key IDs of each mentioned person and place. If a person/place doesn't have a key ID in our spreadsheet or in the XML please indicate this in your list of people and places on the issues board.    
3.  Each team member should select two different elements used in the XML and reflect in 2-4 sentences how the project has further constrained the TEI element. **In total, the team should have 4 2-4 sentence reports on 4 different elements.**  Please refer to the [TEI Guidelines](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html) and [our MIW Encoding Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ReYDRpBSuiVPZsVoj2gOfuz_HP2whJwX-thl4ZtPUws/edit?usp=sharing) for documentation on the TEI's use of an element versus our project team's use. Please provide the 4 reports on your team's issue on [our class's issues board](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues). For example: if you choose the persName or placeName elements (which because they are being used here as examples you should not) then you would write about how the project has constrained those elements by adding the key attribute and unique key attribute values.
