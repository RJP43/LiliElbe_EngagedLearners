# TEI XML Exercise  
  
Learners should consult our February 12th/14th lesson, [Schematizing XML: TEI and Project Constraints](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/wiki/Schematizing-XML:-TEI-and-Project-Constraints), and our February 14th in-class example, [German letter 2](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues/9), while completing this exercise. For this exercise learners will be working in pairs to analyze the encoding of the Lili Elbe project's [archival materials](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/tree/master/ProjectDocs/archivalMaterials).   
  
## Logistics  
  
To begin, download both your specific team's XML and our project schema. Then associate our schema to your team's assigned XML. Instructions to download and associate are available under the section title "[How to Associate the Lili Elbe Digital Archive's (TEI-based) Schema](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/wiki/Schematizing-XML:-TEI-and-Project-Constraints#how-to-associate-the-lili-elbe-digital-archives-tei-based-schema)" of our [Schematizing XML: TEI and Project Constraints](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/wiki/Schematizing-XML:-TEI-and-Project-Constraints) lesson.  

Learners will also need to have the word document and images from which their XML file was created at hand for quick reference. These materials can be found alongside the XML document in the document's specific folder in our class repo's [archival materials folder](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/tree/master/ProjectDocs/archivalMaterials).  
  
Learners will answer the questions and information requests under the "Requirements" section of this document in the issue each team has been assigned to on [our class's issues board](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues). In order to complete this assignment each learner of the team must equally contribute by responding on the specific issue they are assigned. There will not by anything each team needs to upload to SAKAI; however, **one member for each team will be required to re-upload the team's assigned XML file in order to prove the team has correctly associated the project schema**. Please follow the instructions under the heading "Adding an existing file directly on GitHub" of our [Working in GitHub wiki](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/wiki/Working-in-GitHub#uploading-directly-on-github).   
  
## Requirements  
1.  Associate [the project schema](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/blob/master/WIKIandREADMEmaterials/MIWschema.rng) with your team's assigned XML document. Re-upload your team's assigned XML to your assigned document's folder in [the archival materials folder](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/tree/master/ProjectDocs/archivalMaterials) of our class repository. Review the schema-validated XML and report an explanation of any errors firing in the XML on your team's issue on [our class's issues board](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues).  
2.  Identify all of the unique places and people mentioned in your XML and list them on your team's issue on [our class's issues board](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues). Refer to our [spreadsheet of propography IDs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TGp-RpKQi7rLHhdZTs4Vr6Ft91kPipfBwQR_7ii9bng/edit?usp=sharing) to verify each person and place has been given the correct key attribute value and report on your team's issue they key IDs of each mentioned person and place.  
3.  Each team member should select two different elements used in the XML and reflect in 3-5 sentences how the project has further constrained the TEI element. **In total, the team should have 4 3-5 sentence reports on 4 different elements.**  Please refer to the [TEI Guidelines](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html) and [our MIW Encoding Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ReYDRpBSuiVPZsVoj2gOfuz_HP2whJwX-thl4ZtPUws/edit?usp=sharing) for documentation on the TEI's use of an element versus our project team's use. Please provides the 4 reports on your team's issue on [our class's issues board](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues).    
4.  Each team member should review the transcription word document and image file of their team's text and write a 3-5 sentence giving explanation of how the project team could of used a different element, in the [TEI Guidelines](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html), to represent some structural or contextual aspect of the text. **In total, the team should have 2 3-5 sentence explanations of 2 alternative TEI elements that could have been used to capture 2 different structural or contextual components of the text**. Please provides the 2 explanations on your team's issue on [our class's issues board](https://github.com/RJP43/LiliElbe_EngagedLearners/issues).
